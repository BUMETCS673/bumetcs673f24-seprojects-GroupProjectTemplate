# Team Blockbuster - Top Movies API

#### BU MET CS673 O1: Software Engineering, Fall 2024 - Team 6

## Project Description

Team Blockbuster is creating a microservice Data Science application which will provide the ability to query and display movie data based on various user inputs.

## Motivation

This application provides information for people who are curious about movie trends such as movies ratings across different countries, 
different movie durations, specific movie genres and categories, etc. This information can help people working in the film industry or similar 
industries in making important movie development choices.

## Framework

This microservice based application is built using a **Python Flask** framework where **ReactJS** will be used to create a frontend web-page where the user 
can input data points and **Python** will be used to manage backend operations that generate the movie data based on the input data received. 
**SQLite** will be used as the application's database. 

Overview:

- **Frontend:** ReactJS 
- **Backend:** Python
- **Database:** SQLite

The following technologies will be used for our project:

- Python (**v3.12**)
- pip (**v24.2**)

# Second-Hand Market

## Project Description

Second-hand trading is gaining popularity among university students. This platform, tailored for BU students, enables buying and selling of used items like phones, computers, and furniture, etc. It aims to offer a convenient way to trade goods within the university, promoting sustainability and benefiting the community. Our goal is to foster an eco-friendly, green, and inclusive environment. Technically, we use the latest tech stack. Since this is a B/S system, we use Java with Spring Boot and MySQL for the backend, and Node.js with Vue for the frontend. For CI/CD, we rely on GitHub Actions, and the system is deployed on the cloud using Docker and Kubernetes.

## Related Work

A few well-known examples include Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, and OfferUp. These platforms allow users to buy and sell items within local communities. While they serve a broad audience, they do not focus on specific groups like university students. 

**Facebook Marketplace:** (1) Target Audience: Open to the general public, allowing people to buy and sell within their local areas.(2) Key Features: Offers item listings with images, location-based browsing, and integrated messaging. It also allows sellers to market to a larger audience.(3) Differences: Our platform is exclusive to BU students, fostering a sense of trust and community. Additionally, we emphasize sustainability by promoting the reuse of items within the university.

**Craigslist:** (1) Target Audience: Open to anyone, with categories ranging from jobs to housing to items for sale. (2) Key Features: A minimalistic user interface with text-based listings, location-based search, and simple buyer-seller communication. (3) Differences: Craigslist has a broad audience, but lacks the tailored, university-specific focus and a more modern, user-friendly interface. Our platform is specifically designed for BU students, with features like verified student accounts to enhance trust.

**OfferUp:** (1) Target Audience: General public, with a focus on local transactions. (2) Key Features: Mobile-friendly app, location-based item search, and built-in messaging for easy buyer-seller communication. (3) Differences: OfferUp is more polished but lacks the exclusive community focus. Our platform provides a safer and more trusted environment as all users are verified BU students.

Overall, while these platforms cater to a wider audience, our system's advantage lies in creating a secure, eco-conscious, and community-driven marketplace that addresses the specific needs of university students.

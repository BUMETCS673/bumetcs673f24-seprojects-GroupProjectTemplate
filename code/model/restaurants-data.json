The ambiance was spot on too, with a cozy yet lively vibe that made the evening feel special.\n\nAs for the food, it did not disappoint! We started with the steak tartare and bone marrow appetizers, both of which were insanely good. The steak tartare was perfectly seasoned, and the bone marrow was so rich and flavorful\u2014it was hard to pick a favorite between the two. For the mains, we had the salmon and shrimp entrees, and both were cooked to perfection. Fresh, flavorful, and just the right portion size.\n\nDefinitely a place worth visiting again!",

Just beware if you go whent he Red Sox are playing. Its going to be packed and very loud!  Still a great spot. Will defiantly come again and would highly recommend.\n\nTuna crudo- large portion of tuna. Good quality too.  Came with waterlon that tasted like it was marinated with jalapeno. Great flavor combination 4/5\n\nCorn soup- the soup was thick and pretty creamy. Had   bold sweetness to it as well. Would have been nice if some sort of protein was added to it for texture-like other places, but was still very good 4.5/5\n\nLobster gnocchi- this is a special they have each Friday. This was delicous. A good amount of perfectly tender lobster. The gnocchi was pillowy soft and came with a super savory brown butter sauce. There was some lemon in there to adding some nice acidity.  5/5\n\nButterscotch bread pudding-Delicious but  BEWARE! This thing is a beast. It's basically half a loaf of bread topped with butterscotch and ice cream. I can eat a lot of food but even I couldn't finish this. That being said the bread was dense, but also soft. Combined with the ice cream and delicious butterscotch sauce this this was soo good. 5/5",

                "text": "My first visit to the new Eastern Standard! I remember fondly the old location and was eager to try the new iteration. I think there may still be some hiccups to work out but the bones are there for it to become the institution it once was. First of all the location is PHENOMENAL for anyone going to an event at Fenway. We made a reservation for our Monday night dinner before a concert at MGM & it was a smart move because the places filled very quickly! Our server was kind and capable, nothing that truly wowed but absolutely acceptable service. We enjoyed the lobster filled squash blossoms which were a highlight of the meal! The Caesar salad was perfectly serviceable but not something I would bother with again.\n\nMy friend and I were both looking forward to the bone marrow as it was a favorite for us at the old location. It was good but left something to be desired in the texture. Rather than being hot and melting into the bread accompaniment as you spread it the way we remembered the marrow was luke warm and still a bit gelatinous. The viscosity wasn\u2019t offensive but wasn\u2019t the pleasant, oozing, unctuous meat butter that we had remembered from days of yore. It perhaps just needed a bit more time under heat before being served.\n\nWe also enjoyed the Steak Frites which the kitchen was kind enough to split for us. It was a delightful entree, the steak perfectly cooked to our preference and the aioli on the side was delicious with the fries. It gave all the things you want when you indulge in steak frites.\n\nThe cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e we chose to end our meal with was more than decent in flavor but slightly off in texture. It wasn\u2019t fully firm & thus was a bit of a let down as the close of our meal.\n\nOverall it was a fine first visit with a great view of the Boston skyline with Fenway from its elevated perch over the street. In time this may just be the dining destination it has the potential to be and I will certainly be back to watch its evolution.",

                "text": "This is our second time seeing a concert at House of Blues. The first time was to see James Blunt and most recently, Judah and the Lion.\n\nThe venue is intimate with decent acoustics. We didn\u2019t notice any of the reverb or distortion we\u2019ve experienced at larger or very small show spaces.\n\nWife and I are both disabled and opted for ADA seats.  The staff was very polite and we were escorted to our seats on the 3rd floor via a dedicated elevator.\n\nThe seats themselves were actually high-quality folding chairs with no padding. Luckily we anticipated this and brought our own cushions. The area was \u201cguarded\u201d by a staff member which meant we weren\u2019t bothered by regular patrons trying to get a better view.\n\nOur only complaint was that while sitting (which we need to do the majority of the time) the railing blocked our view. To see the stage we either needed to peek through the steel balusters or lean over the railing.  Notably, for those restricted to wheelchairs, it appeared there was an area (with a perfect, centered, unobstructed view of the stage).\n\nIf you can manage a few stairs, there were standard arena style chairs in the \u201cstadium level.\u201d\n\nThe aforementioned is less a complaint and more simply informational for those covered by ADA. Overall, we were very pleased with the care, courtesy and respect with which we were treated.\n\nWithout reservation, we recommend House of Blues as a concert venue!",

The menu was substantial, about of things looked good. I settled on the steak bowl, with a chicken tortilla soup. Because of the large menu, I was expecting frozen food, tough steak etc, but I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nThe soup was delicious. Creamy, hot, and fresh. It had little bits of avocado on top and big chunks of chicken. Delicious. The steak bowl had some of the best cooked steak I have ever had. Super tender and perfectly cooked.\n\nBeer was good, food was excellent, and service was great. And you can\u2019t beat the people watching from the patios.",

It\u2019s odd service like this that has me baffled versus any other Chipotle location I\u2019ve ever been to.\nAs others have mentioned, the workers are really rude and it\u2019s usually filthy in here.

They deserve all the praise.\nHowever, I had an issue with one of the security personnel right before you enter. I carry pepper spray for self defense and they took it away from me and said that I wouldn't get it back when I left the establishment. I've had no problems carrying it at venues larger than Lucky Strike. In the worst case, security would confiscate it for the duration of the show, label it with my name, and then give it back to me on my way out. Secondly, it's fully legal to carry pepper spray in MA. I didn't put up a fight because I assumed a bouncer would know better. Turns out they didn't. I had to pick my battles because I wasn't going to be let in if I didn't let them confiscate it. This review is so other people know their rights and don't let this happen to them. I'm truly disappointed because I've had good experiences at Lucky Strike but that night ruined it for me and I don't wanna go back anymore.",

                "text": "\ud83c\udf1e **Sunset Cantina Review** \ud83c\udf2e\ud83c\udf79\n\n**Location & Vibe:** Tucked away on Commonwealth Ave, Sunset Cantina promises an experience that's vibrant with a casual, sports-bar atmosphere. Known for its history as a gathering spot for BU students, my boyfriend and I ventured there hoping to relive some fond memories of nacho-filled evenings. The ambiance is laid-back, perfect for a lively game night. \ud83c\udfc8\ud83c\udf7b\n\n**Drinks:** The bar at Sunset Cantina remains its stronghold. With a robust selection of cocktails and beers, the drinks are crafted to kickstart any gathering. We found the cocktails to be particularly well-mixed, adding a refreshing twist to our afternoon. \ud83c\udf78\u2728\n\n**Starters - Chips & Queso Dip:** Our meal started on a shaky note with the chips, which were unfortunately stale, detracting from the overall enjoyment. However, the queso dip provided a slight redemption with its intriguing mix of grilled corn salsa and a dash of tajin, offering a zesty flavor that partially made up for the lackluster chips. \ud83c\udf3d\ud83e\uddc0 Rating: 4/10\n\n**Main Attraction - Beef Empanadas:** The highlight of our dining experience came in the form of their beef empanadas. Filled with tender, slow-cooked shredded beef and creamy Monterey Jack cheese, these empanadas were flavorful and cooked to a delightful finish, standing out as the most memorable dish of our visit. \ud83e\udd5f\ud83c\udf1f Rating: 7/10\n\n**Salads - A Healthy Twist:** We sampled the Mexican Caesar and steak & avocado salads, aiming for something on the lighter side. While both salads were generous in portion, featuring a decent amount of meat, they lacked a certain flair and were generally average, failing to impress beyond their wholesome presentation. \ud83e\udd57\ud83e\udd51 Rating: 5/10\n\n**Birria Tacos - A Missed Opportunity:** As a fan of birria tacos, I was eager to dive into this dish, but it fell short of expectations. The tacos lacked the rich, deep flavor typical of birria, and the meat was scant, leading to an unbalanced bite where the taco shell overshadowed the filling. \ud83c\udf2e\ud83d\udc4e Rating: 4/10\n\n**Overall Experience:**\nWhile the drinks lived up to the festive spirit of the place, the food struggled to match up, delivering a mixed bag of hits and misses. The setting and price point make it a reasonable choice for casual dining, especially if you're in the area to watch a sports event and enjoy some drinks.\n\n**Final Scores:**\n- **Food:** 5/10\n- **Affordability:** 7/10\n- **Ambiance:** 5/10\n\nHoping my feedback is seen as constructive. I love capturing and sharing food experiences and always root for places to thrive. \ud83d\udcf8\ud83d\udc96 If you're looking to watch a sports game with a good drink this might still be your spot!",

The staff was very attentive and great at giving me a wine recommendation (cono 4). Croquetas were solid (they upsell you to get 4 instead of 3 but I\u2019m not complaining). Goat cheese toasts were good too and worth it to share with more than 2 people because of how dense they are. Onto the shrimp, the oil they were in was phenomenal. Loved to dip the bread in there. Mushrooms were extremely yummy as well, and the classic spanish egg topping is always a nice touch. I look forward to coming back sometime to try more of their menu.",

We started with an order of ham croquetas and batatas bravas.  Both were very good, though I had better in Spain.  We shared a seafood paella and it was outstanding,  equal to any I've tried over there.  Truly mouth watering,  with loads of seafood.  Our server was super friendly.  I know that some restaurants like to dim the lights for atmosphere,  but it was too dark.  I recommend this restaurant,  but if you come,  bring a flashlight.",

The Bucket of Biscuits  was the best start to the meal\nThey were buttery and fluffy with a crisp crusty outside. We tried the beef riv, pulled pork, brisket and fried chicken with multiple sides. The meat was very tender. We did both spicy and plain fried chicken. The spicy is spicy, so, keep it in mind.",

The sides were even better (except the okra which was bland). Their biscuits are well made with good structural integrity and tasty butter to match.\n\nMy only gripe was how much upselling the menu and our server were doing. For example, she warned us the okra was pretty bland and offered some dips at an extra cost. I would have preferred they make the okra tastier instead of upselling dips.\n\nOverall a good experience and I plan to return.",

The honey butter and jam just melt in your mouth. We inhaled our brisket before I could get a photo but that was top notch as well. Loved the pickles. The staff was kind enough to get two bowls of water (one for each of our pups) and gave them lots of pets when refilling their water. Do yourself a favor and get the side of Mac and cheese",

While placing a group order under my name, my friend put in her credit card information but forgot to add a tip. When one of the employees came to deliver our order, he called my phone and refused to leave until I either gave him a tip via app or cash. I explained our mistake and requested for him to leave the order down at the front desk. I told him that I would call the restaurant to add a tip. The employee continued to text and call my phone and only left when I called the restaurant and requested for them to contact him and intervene. I ended up having to block his number. I 100% believe that food service employees should be paid and tipped adequately for their services. However, I don\u2019t think that tips are warranted after repeated badgering and refusal to have a civil conversation.",

Enjoyed the outdoor dining and we got the combinations and steak. Firstly, their chips and salsa were amazing and really one of the best I have ever had. It was really fresh and delicious. Drinks were amazing with lot of booze in it. Steak, beans, salads, cheese, chicken, beef, tacos and everything was great and really well cooked. Definitely a great place to visit and customer service was fantastic  they were very polite, funny and friendly. Little pricey but it's in the busy Brookline Beacon Street. Will definitely visit again \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f",

They drinks are good and the staff are accommodating with the customer request. I ordered a guava premium drink and asked them to make it spicy and they really surprised me :)\n\nThe enchiladas were great as well. Special mention to the in house spicy sauce. They are delicious and you won\u2019t feel the spicy for a second. After you take a taste, you are gonna feel a burn down your throat. I like spicy and it was perfect for me.\n\nWould I recommend this restaurant: hell, yeah. It is a good place for a dinner date :)",

I\u2019ve been here several times and I\u2019ve never had a bad entree. I\u2019ve had the enchiladas and the quesadillas and really liked them! One thing I\u2019ll make mention of is the queso asada appetizer. It\u2019s not like normal queso which I associate with a creamy thick cheese sauce. Ours was more like melted cheese that kind of stuck to the cast iron skillet it was in. It was still good, but it was more solid and greasy than expected.",

I requested a miso soup instead of the mushroom soup listed on the menu, but they don't allow substitution which is sad. Despite the steep prices, the quality falls short compared to other Japanese restaurants nearby that has lower prices and better food.",

Came with tasty basmati rice and the garlic naan was delicious.  Also they bring papadam and sauces free at the beginning.\n\nLittle details were surprisingly nice: folded napkins, well prepared table, mint chocolate at the end and guava candies by the door.  The staff were cool people and they provided good service.",

The waiters are talking to themselves most times in hindi but sometimes it makes you feel like they are talking about you.\nNostalgic Bollywood music is playing all the time, love it!\nMasala chai is top notch and that too with free refills!\nGot samosa chat - complex delicious flavors, good portion size, decent price point.\nBhel puri - the quantity is way less than I expected. Taste is okay. I would go for samosa chat over bhel.\nOrdered kadai paneer both times. It comes with rice so its a full meal in itself. Filling and delicious and does taste like ready to eat tomato paste gravy which I appreciate.\n\nI will visit every time i go back to Boston!",

The experience of the food is in the taste of it, a result of the centuries of wisdom that go into the spice combinations, plus the care and dedication of the staff.\nAs cuisines go, Indian food's focus on the taste and texture, but not so much the look of it  (that's true of all Indian and Himalayan cuisines...photos of Indian food are never much to look at), and never the whole story. You have to experience the subtle explosion of textures and flavors in your mouth.\nAnother great feature of Indian cuisine is that they've created a wide variety of vegan and vegetarian options. It's possible to load up on supremely tasty plant protein here.\nThe most remarkable thing about India Quality is the pricing. It almost seems as if their menu prices froze in the '90s - there are appetizers for under $5, and everything is really tasty and great.\nGo! You'll love it.",

The quality of ingredients is always fresh and carefully prepared, and the flavors are truly authentic. Whether I\u2019m enjoying the tender cuts of beef, the food has consistently exceeded my expectations. The staff are attentive and friendly, always ensuring that my dining experience is smooth and enjoyable. They are quick to refill drinks, adjust the grill if needed, and answer any questions about the menu, which I really appreciate. The restaurant environment is warm and inviting, perfect for gathering with friends or family.\nHowever, I would definitely recommend making a reservation at least a day in advance, as the wait times can be quite long without one, especially during peak hours. Also, keep in mind that Gyu-Kaku currently doesn\u2019t accept Apple Pay, so be prepared with an alternate form of payment. Overall, Gyu-Kaku has become one of my favorite places to dine, and I look forward to many more enjoyable meals here. Highly recommended!\nIn fact, if Boston were ever to lose Gyu-Kaku, I might seriously consider transferring schools just to follow this restaurant! It\u2019s become one of my primary sources of comfort and motivation as a student.",

Sometimes the servers forgot our order/ order it would come out much later than previous orders, but that might be because they need to keep track of all the tables.\nGreat beef selection for an AYCE menu.

The vibe for sitting is really great if the cafe is not fully packed. The bagels are very delicious while on the pricy end. I like to have avocado and sprout with cream cheese everything bagel. I also like their lox bagel. It is my favorite for takeout since it is usually very packed though. The cafe used to have a point system that used to get connected to your phone number. Unfortunately that is gone now. It would be great if the owner could bring back the point system just like JAHO coffee shop does.\nGRS school often also gives graduate students coupon for getting free coffee from this Pavement location.",

Most recently I got it and there were a few chunks of pineapple in it, the dish was overly sweet with no hint of spice to it what-so-ever. Usually there's a bit of chili flavor and a zing of ginger, but this time it just tasted like soy sauce and pineapple juice, a little disappointing. Always quick service and friendly employees when I pick up takeout.",

The guacamole quality at chipotle can really range from location to location but this chipotle has perfectly made guacamole every time. They never skimp on portions. The employees are helpful and fast. There is never a line because they always work so quickly and efficiently. As an extremely picky eater I appreciate consistency in food taste and texture. For any one who loves chipotle, who is going to be in Boston for even just one  night, it would be a shame not to try this chipotle.",

Since then, every night after 9 p.m., I've been ordering chicken and during the daytime full bowl. However, over time, some employees started being rude and giving me dirty looks when I order. One woman even asked me why I only order chicken.i don't mind being open worh people, but that question didn'tcome from a good place. If they couldn't do it, they should've just told me from the beginning. The manager even yelled at the only woman who was trying to be nice. The woman that apparently has a problem with me initiated a conversation in Creole with the friend in front of me. Which made me and my friend very uncomfortable.\nI know things get very stressful throughout the day, but this whole situation was unnecessary and avoidable. Finally the only nice young woman kindly said that they can't do that.\nUnfortunately, I won't be eating in this place anymore because of how poorly a simple situation was handled.",

El Pelon used to be the most decent one in the area, but its quality has gone down in the past few years. I used to order their Platos for delivery occasionally, but I recently had a bad experience with the pork and chicken platos. Both meats were dry, and the toppings lacked the punch of flavor you'd expect. Even compared to local chains like El Jefe\u2019s, it fell flat. The Steak Platos I tried during lunch were a slight improvement, but not enough to quench my Mexican cravings.\n\nIt\u2019s a shame that El Pelon is still considered the best takeout Mexican option near Fenway. Not sure if I\u2019ll be going back.",

I ordered a steak taco, a chicken quesadilla, and a kids cheese quesadilla. Their tacos don't have the standard ingredients you'd find on a taco - raw onions and cilantro. The flavor of the steak wasn't great. The chicken quesadilla was overwhelming with the amount of chicken that was in it. The chicken also had light shades of pink, making me put it down. My child said their meal was good, but I didn't try it. You can't really mess a cheese quesadilla up. The kids' meal came with tortilla chips, which tasted stale and old. The vibe of the restaurant was cool and different, but food wise, it was not great.",

He said they were decent.  I ordered a turkey club with fries.  The problem was my sandwich didn't arrive until 15 minutes after the pancakes! My friend had already finished eating! My sandwich was okay,  but it shouldn't take 25 minutes for it to come out,  especially since it wasn't that busy.  The onion rings we ordered were also just alright.  I can't recommend this place although the server was friendly.",

The service was super quick to bring out waters and our orders. We got a bagel and an order of french toast. The french toast in my opinion was a bit too egg-y and bland for me, so I will not recommend that. We did have to go back inside to ask for the check after a while which I'm sure is just the diner's attitude of having us sit around for as long as we wanted.",

However, was very disappointed - especially with the dough, which was really chewy. The bacon and ranch was really, really salty, too. The cheese slice was better, but still far from good.\n\nThe slices are not cheap (they start at $7 and go up from there), which I kinda get because of the location right next to Red Sox stadium, but it's still a pricey slice of pizza.",

I couldn\u2019t finish the slice, it was so bad (and I was hungry!). It\u2019s also outrageously overpriced at $11+/slice.  Opt for Joe\u2019s in Cambridge; New York Pizza (various locations) or Supremes on Mass Ave.  All solid stand-bys.\nWent in at around 11am and yet the pizza looked and tasted old with congealed cheese. Leaves me to believe it was left over from previous day(?)",

                "text": "The barista Alex, he is very rude and mean. My friend ordered two drinks for us on the app ahead, when we got to the store to pick up the drinks, one of the drink was ready and the other one was not. Since she ordered ahead and the status showing the order is completed, she checked with the barista to confirm it is not ready yet(we have no problem to wait couple more minutes, just want to confirm no one else took it by mistake and the barista is aware of the drink is not ready). The barista Alex, he looked my friends up and down, said \u201cno it is not ready, if it is ready then it is here\u201d. We were so confused about his mean and unfriendly attitude, but we still said \u201cok sure\u201d and wait. Then we watched him laughing with his other co-worker, talking about something, then pick up a cup asking his co-worker \u201chey is this with the xxx tea?\u201d While he was working on that drink we felt the micro aggressive atmosphere that he intended to show and teach us \u201cdon\u2019t ask and you have to wait\u201d. We are not sure if he is a part time who is really young and lack of work experience so he don\u2019t know how to work in retail or he is just simply intend to do so because he is not a nice person. Either way he is THE MEANEST PERSON I have ever met in a Starbucks. To the store manager, if you want to keep the location\u2019s good reputation, employee training is essential, I guess especially for Alex.",

They finally show up and I walk back to my office. I just opened up my egg bites and am greeted by two dark brown shriveled hockey pucks that were lost in the back of the oven last month and were just discovered this morning - unfortunately not worth walking back 10 minutes to wait in line and request a replacement but hopefully this review is seen by management and used to train staff on what\u2019s acceptable to serve.\n\nI can handle food being well-done / \u201ccrispy\u201d but these are inedible and completely unrecognizable from the product I ordered - if they were donuts or pastries I could have at least reconstituted them by dunking them in my coffee - to quote a well known Scottish chef, \u201cWhat A SHAME!\u201d",

We were the only ones. The waitress brought our menus right away and gave us time to review. She brought us room temperature water and sat on her phone. She came and took our order. The meals were made from scratch. I had veggie noodles and my daughter had dumplings. The veggies were bok choy, carrots, sweet peppers, scallions and onions. It was a little salty. We were hungry so we ate it. An older woman brought out our meals. She smiled. That was the warmest part of the customer service. We didn\u2019t wait for our bill, we went to counter to pay and left. We were thanked as we walked out the door.",

You can tell how much pride they take in their restaurant. Our meal was about half the cost of other sushi places, but better than what I\u2019ve had in a long time! My husband got the chicken ramen (the broth was incredible) and I got a sushi combo, which came with a small salad, miso soup, and a drink. The sushi was wonderful, and the rice was seasoned perfectly and so soft and fresh. If we\u2019re ever in the neighborhood again, we know where we\u2019re going for lunch!",

I had an Oktoberfest beer and 'A sure thing' mixed cocktail, which were both great, especially the cocktail which left me tipsy a few sips in \ud83e\udd74. For food, I ordered the grilled cheese dip, roasted beets and churros (secret menu item lol because no desserts are listed). All of which were awesome, my favorite being the roasted beets. It wasn't very busy (Thursday night), so the bartender was very attentive and it wasn't too loud.",

Barely enough for one, let alone two (16.00) the Brussels where huge and not very tasty. The crust had a good crunch. Def would try the chicken Sammy or burger. Overall, just ok.",

Desserts all looked delicious! We noted the menu does have a few good and savoury vegetarian options available. BUT..\nThey forgot about our ice tea order and we were left waiting for more than a half n hour. Only to have it taste like WATER, literally! No flavour at all. It was quite the disappointment bcuz everything is on the pricy side.",

It was cute and air conditioned. We got two meals. The breakfast sandwich on a croissant was so flakey buttery cheesy and delicious! He got a grilled cheese with goat cheese and beets I think. It was different and not my thing as I\u2019m a picky eater. We got a raspberry muffin and a tart and both pastries were yummy! Will definitely be back!",

The Tom Yom soup and Honey Chicken Wings were pretty good. Good flavor and cooked well.\n\nI ordered the chicken Pad See-U. This was completely inedible. The chicken was dry and overcooked. It tasted old. The whole entire dish had zero flavor. I couldn\u2019t stomach it and ended up tossing it.\n\nMy partner ordered the Khao Pad Thai Jungle Beef. This had very mild flavoring overall. He had to add a bunch of soy sauce to make it more edible.\n\nThis was the worst Thai food we\u2019ve ever had and worst overall Uber Eats order.\n\nDo yourself a favor and order from Rod Thai Family Taste or Thaitation in Fenway.",

We saw all the food were well packed on the desk, but just turned to the other side, unable to see the name. We are attempted to ask could we check the name, they refused, we have to wait to be called. After another 15 minutes, they eventually came out, and started calling the name.

I honestly love going to Marciano Commons (Marcys) every day!\n\nI will say that basically the same food is served here, with the exception of a few departments. That being said, I don't mind that fact! I will eat literally the same thing every day and be fine! It is very predictable what Marcys will and will not have.\n\nAlso the bakery is AMAZING. They are always churning out new creative sweets that I like to sample!\n\nI absolutely love coming here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner!\nOne thing to watch out for is what I call \"rush hour\" which basically is weekdays from 11am to 3pm where it is really busy there. If you go before or after those times though it is so nice!\n\nI love the views of Kenmore from the back side of Marciano, that is my favorite place to sit.\n\nAlso like, unlimited ice cream? Yes please!!\n\nTo sum up though the enviornment is pretty upscale, food is yummy and consistent, and the bakery is amazing.\n\nEasily the best Dining Hall here at BU.",

Most of these experiments fail miserably, leaving poor students to find alms at restaurants near by. The omelets tend to be rubbery, but the breakfast food is decent.  The lunch service is a hit or miss- and in general, the burgers are overcooked and the entrees are under seasoned and bland. Dinner is normally terrible. It's still better than most dining halls though.\n\nSome of the staff are genial, polite, and nice. Many members are apathetic, but that is normal with most food service jobs. I do have to say that the plates and cups are not often very clean.",

Asking for anything outside the normal \"everything\" that students usually ask for is meant with at least an eye roll and look of disdain. I can't even ask for fresh eggs without fearing for my life. They have no respect for cultural foods and believe putting pickled cabbage on a dish makes it \"korean\".

There were plenty of ungrateful individuals that clearly treat restaurant staff as less than. I hope, it\u2019s our hope that as customers we are pleasant and clean up after ourselves.\nWe love the staff at Wahlburgers and want you to know you are appreciated.\nFirst time visitors and the food was delicious. Especially the onion rings, seriously delicious. My wife had a veggie burger and she loved it. I\u2019m a big boy and had a double cheeseburger outstanding.\nService was superb especially since a rude table of 7 snuck in and stole a table.\nIf I had the money I\u2019d have tipped more.\nYes I took pictures of Wahlberg\u2019s movie posters especially \u201cShooter\u201d in the bathroom hall. Which by the way, bathrooms very clean.\nThanks again for all you all do and making this a great experience.",

The way I was looked at, apparently frustrating them immensely. I have never experienced such a bad treatment before.

It was just cheese and pepperoni, and it was missing the condiment. Seriously though, how do you forget sauce on a pizza?It\u2019s even specified in the order. Granted, it\u2019s almost 2 hours until closing, and the work staff might be tired (as someone who used to work in the food industry, I get it), but this location has some serious quality control standards.

                "text": "Entrance felt like legit Japanese Restaurant and then inside was a different bar/modern Restaurant feel. Service was great. Waitress was kind and checked on us often. They also gave us this pill-tissue/hankerchief where you dip in warm water and it blows up so you can wipe your hands. Apparently a welcoming gesture in Japan for guests. Pretty cool.\n\nStarted with drinks and I tried one of the two frozen cocktails called Pina Colada. It was like a slush and with strong alcohol. I liked it a lot, except it would melt if you drink too slowly \ud83e\udd79. It was one of my highlights though - would highly recommend.\n\nFood was overall decent. My favorite was the brussel sprout - oooh that was yummy. Sushi + fried chicken + fries were decent/normal, nothing eye-opening. Kimchi fried rice felt a little 'wet' for me and a little too salty (especially for someone who cook the stuff). I felt the portion size was on the smaller end for the price, especially as a shareable. It felt more like appetizer, size-wise.\n\nDessert: honey cake was good, though I prefer it cold than warm. The home-made ice cream felt more like gelato. It was sticky and not my favorite kind. A little too sweet. Was unique texture and shape. I think it was like peanut butter-sesame-matcha flavor for the sundae?\n\nOverall, great service and atmosphere for a get-together. Personally would recommend the Brussel sprouts and the Pina Colada. If you are looking for something truly Japanese this ain't the place, but if you want something more casual, pub-like, something-for-everyone type of place, give this a try! Cheers \ud83d\ude0a.",

I had a japas matsurika beer because they were out of Sapporo unfortunately. I had the snow crab California roll, the shiitake mushroom tempura roll, and the traditional Japanese honey cake. All were good, but not knocking my socks off. The shiitake roll was honestly weird because of the truffle foam on top, not my thing I guess. Prices are okay, I spent about $80 with those four items mentioned plus tip. It was also very dark inside and not too busy, but maybe there's more people on the weekend.",

                "text": "I purchased 2 pizzas on gluten free crust. People rave about Otto pizza, but I must have caught them on an off day, because while I love the array of toppings I can choose from, it was just good not great. It did arrive nice and warm, which is more than I can say for my last pizza delivery that was from a location much closer.\n\nOne order was wrong, and the other was not right either, and one side of the bottom of the pizza crust was charred- and not the nice pizza char, but had a burnt taste.\n\nWhat was supposed to be a 4 cheese pizza with extra sauce butternut squash and roasted garlic instead had ricotta and parsley.\n\nThe pepperoni pizza had the mushrooms, but almost none, and only one one side really when it was supposed to be the entire pizza. I was wondering if they ran out but didn't think to call and tell me and ask if I wanted something else.\n\nThe delivery driver also went to an address down the street. All he had to do was keep driving straight down the street as he was on the street. Told me it took him to another address on the same street. I told him to keep driving straight. It was super weird. I felt like he was filling in for someone else, maybe?\n\nI emailed about what happened and haven't heard back from them.  Variety is the spice of life, so go, but be mindful what you paid for may not be what you get.",

I first came here when I was saying goodbye to my mom when she was dropping me off for college and this was the best place I could've chosen. First off the service is amazing! Anytime I walk in I'm greeted with a smile! For someone who gets anxiety when ordering food, they are so patient and sweet when taking your order! I've come here about 5-6 times now in a span of a month, alone and with friends just for their food and for the vibe this place gives. My favorite is sitting in the middle table eating my baked pasta with meatballs and catching up with my besties or sitting by the window and people watching those who walk by. When I feel like I need to eat something else other than dining hall food, this is my place to go due to convenience of location, quality of food, and service. Plus I never finish the food so I get to take this back to my room to heat up for later eats! (Bang for your buck\ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11) If you're looking for a place to eat around BU's campus I totally recommend!",

I walked in.\nModern look of an old school Greek fast food place.\nHow do I know I worked in some of them.\nThe man on the counter was very polite, took my order. Great.\nI ordered 2 large subs, 2 slices and French fries $50!!!\n\nThe receipt they give is the total without breaking down all individual items. I said to myself if the food is delicious I will not be mad if I paid so much money. I tried the food.\n\nThe two slices were ok. The crust of the pizza was wrinkled l, which means was left out for a long time uncovered and during baking have this type of crust. The tomato sauce was good. The slice itself was on the thin side, hard to eat it directly, needs to use a fork and a knife.\n\nThe 2 subs tasted very blend. No salt no black pepper on the steak bomb. The bread could be a better quality.\nThe French fries no seasoning at all. Bland tasting.\nMy discovery, someone then they packed the fries put salt and pepper packets on the bottom of the bag. On top put the plate and the French fries. How the hell you can go to the bottom of the bag take salt and pepper and season your fries?!\n\nIn conclusion. This is a typical low quality fast food place. They can do much better but prefer fast money and lacking details.",

Back in Spring 2020 (before covid lockdown) I was teaching in basement of GRA building and discovered this hidden gem right inside the university. I love their bagels and cream cheeses and the vibe there. Recently, they are also using a very seamless system for ordering through your credit card or BU ID that connects to grubhub. Orders are fast. Staff are very helpful. Great vibe for studying. Doesn\u2019t feel like a basement. Highly suggest all BU students to try it. I ordered lox bagel and it was very delicious. The ordering menu allows you to customize the ingredients.\n\nUpdate: sadly, this place is closed during Summer 2022 semester.",

It is expensive to become a member but sometimes you can add it on for $20-$30. I find myself wanting to spend as much time in the Foundation Room as I do the venue floor while there.\nThe decor is phenomenal, psychedelic, and the pictures are just a fraction of the splendor. Theres plenty of space to settle in with a large or small group here, and there's even a deck! There's TVs throughout the rooms with stage on display.\nAlso separate bathrooms and bar from the main show. (drinks are cheaper downstairs though)",

It was supposed to be a rum and coke but there was no rum. My girlfriend had a cocktail with gin. I strongly dislike the taste of gin but when I tasted her drink I could not taste any gin. Then we ordered food. My girlfriend ordered the cajun pasta . It tasted good but barely had any chicken or sausage. I ordered a burger. I requested it be cooked medium. It was barely cooked so I had to send it back. It took several minutes for me to get our waitress' attention. My girlfriend finished her meal before my second burger arrived. This burger was cooked medium rare. It was still undercooked but I ate it anyway because the show was starting soon.  The undercooked burger tasted fine.",

Since they didn\u2019t have whole wheat subs I was lucky enough that they offered whole wheat wraps. So I got the whole wheat steak and cheese wrap, the French fries and a ceased salad. Everything was pretty good not like crazy over the top good but just right and if you are in the area it\u2019s also perfect for a quick bite on the go, whether that be a slice of pizza or a sub with fries.",

                "text": "A warm, \u2018kozy\u2019 restaurant that I would absolutely recommend for authentic Chinese food! This no-frills restaurant was still busy with deliveries when I arrived with my party, but the person working (which we learned was the owner) there was so welcoming and friendly. When we arrived at around 7 at night, it was pretty easy to find street parking on the side streets.\nWhen my table with some elderly had some trouble with the QR code scanning for menus, she handed us actual menus without asking which I was very grateful for as many places don\u2019t do paper menus anymore.\nWe ended up ordering the beef noodle soup, cumin lamb, juicy pork buns aka soup dumplings, chive and pork pan fried dumplings, fish filet with sour napa, and chive pockets. All of these items arrived so quickly and were so delicious! One of my friends said it was the first time he had something this good since he left home. The \u7ea2\u70e7\u725b\u8089\u9762 beef noodle soup came steaming hot with chewy \u597d\u5f39\u7259 \u2018QQ\u2019 texture noodles and the beef had the perfect amount of chew and soft tenderness. The \u5b5c\u7136\u7f8a\u8089 cumin lamb was amazingly spicy with all the classic garnishes including onion and cilantro, while the \u97ed\u83dc\u6c34\u997a pan fried (pan fried is an extra +$1) chive dumplings and \u97ed\u83dc\u76d2\u5b50chive pockets were crowd favorites for sure! When we were chatting with the owner, she was so sweet and let us know that all the noodles, dumpling wrappers, and baos are handmade! The pan fried chive dumplings and chive pockets had that perfect \u9165\u76ae flakey crispy outside but super flavorful, fragrant, steamy hot inside. The \u5c0f\u7b3c\u5305 juicy pork buns is now one of my favorites in the Boston area as the skin was thin but buns were super juicy and meaty. Tip\u2014ask for their homemade chili oil for an extra kick on all your dishes.\nI personally am not a big fish fan, but I tried a bit of the \u4e1c\u5317\u9178\u83dc\u9c7c fish filet with sour Napa and as a new dish to me, I would describe it as tasty but quite sour. My table found the fish quite good and the sour Napa to be fresh especially as soup with white rice. We also tried their handmade buns at the end of dinner and it was the perfect end to a 10/10 dinner. Our total came to around $80 dollars before tip.\nI will definetly be back to try out the rest of their extensive menu\u2014which has something for everyone from lo mein to dumplings to fried rice!",

The wrap was large, but lacked in the flavor department and as people have stated in their reviews, the burrito was overstuffed so it didn\u2019t fully close which made eating messy (although I did appreciate the extra food). I paid $15 for the wrap, however given the minimal flavor and poor presentation, I feel it was very overpriced. Not to mention, customer service could be better.\n\nAlso, since when does lettuce pair with sushi??",

Now the beef bowl is small, only has three ingredients (beef, lettuce and ginger) all looking being stored for a while. The beef quality and taste is really poor. There is no sauce added any more. This is a joke for a 15-16$ meal.\n\nThe place used to have special drinks and snacks and sushi boxes. Now all shelves are empty and the only drinks are water and coca. People working there don\u2019t show much excitement running the place. One of the entrance doors is broken/locked and they didn\u2019t bother to either fix it or post a sign to let the customers know they shall use the other door. I won\u2019t come back.",

I really enjoyed the No Name -especially as leftovers, however I was disappointed that the Wontons didn\u2019t have a creamy interior, it was just \u201cmeat\u201d. I was expecting to bite into a warm, gooey filling but it was just dry \u201cmeat\u201d stuffing which wasn\u2019t very seasoned. The chick\u2019n fingers would\u2019ve been absolutely perfect except they were too sweet and lacked in the flavor department. I would recommend going! It\u2019s not often you come across an all vegan Chinese restaurant and their menu is extensive. They even have lunch specials (only valid on weekdays)!",

The restaurant is huge with bar seating having individual pots and tables with shared pots. Service was attentive and quick.\n\nThe house broth is included and any flavor is an extra charge. I got the A5 beef regular combo and it came with a choice of noodles and assorted vegetables. The udon noodles and beef were fresh and not frozen. It did give an impression of higher quality than other places. The flavor broth is really good and the portion for the regular meat combo was a good size for one person. You should get a regular combo for each person.",

While we did have to wait a bit to be seated bc they were short handed and looked like a couple larger parties.\nOur food came relatively quickly.  They were able to accommodate a party comprised of a vegetarian + a meat eater.  The pots are divided nicely to support this.  They also were happy to make a few broths vegetarian.  The veggie plate was amazing and the meat was far more than one person could eat.   The vegetarian in our party complimented the vegetarian fish included on the veggie plate. The broths were delicious, the meat was high quality, and veggies were fresh.  Our server was friendly and checked on us frequently.",

On a Saturday night unless you come really early like at 5pm, be prepared for a wait of 30-40 minutes. The service is a little slow and the chatter from patrons can be loud and fills the room. On the positive side, once the food arrives, things move fast. We ordered 3 of the meat combo dishes. The beef, lamb, pork and chicken were of high quality and there were lots of vegetables with each order. They have a good selection of sake and beer and the coconut sorbet was a great way to top off the meal. Parking was hard to find and the small restaurant parking lot fills up fast. All in all it was a very good experience.",

They have a very nice selection of smoke flavors and combine them upon request. They are regular with changing coal.\nThey use Al Fakher smoke, which is my favorite. Really enjoyed the happy hour from 2pm. -6pm.\nI enjoy going there to relax and study, the people are friendly and very professional \ud83d\udc4c\nCongrats! Keep up the good work!\nP.s. Sundays, they have live music, and they also serve food throughout the week (Mediterranean food).",

Last time I went was my last draw here, for ONLY twenty minutes, three people one hookah (only two people smoke) and four spring bottled water final bill came to $60, how idk\u2026also be aware they have 18% gratuity\u201dCOMPULSORY SERVICE CHARGE\u201d, which they don\u2019t tell you about upfront just automatically added to your bill, and there isn\u2019t any obvious hung up signs that says that.

Staff are friendly, but it looks like most sushi places you may have been to around Boston. However, one should only judge sushi on the quality of the fish and this is where Genki Ya shines. Their sashimi is some of the most tasty and freshest that I have tried in Boston--at any price point. The fact that they are relatively inexpensive is a bonus. Maki rolls are mostly of the standard variety, but are well made, but some of their special makis will surprise you. However, I always go for the fish. Highly recommended for a pleasant surprise.",

                "text": "Shockingly bad service which made for an awkward and inadequate experience. I ordered food and 15 minutes after it arrived I hadn't been checked in on, hadn't been offered another drink, had no water, et cetera . . .but the server and another worker came and stood across from my table talking about video games for several minutes. Did they think I was going to dine and dash? Why would 2 workers ignore a customer actively dining, but stand chit chatting facing them? If they have 5 minutes to talk video games, surely they can offer a customer water or other items to order. At the very least, someone could have asked once about my order and/or offered more. I worked as a bartender for a decade. I can't imagine acting this way when my livelihood depends on tips, or even just being so rude to another human. I expected to buy a somewhat overpriced meal, and that's what I signed up for. I did expect at least decent service, or just basic courtesy. Food was good - not great, but I read the reviews and was on board for that. Side note: the atmosphere inside seemed nice, and the bartender also seemed friendly and competent in contrast. It's a VERY rare occasion where I tip less than 20%, even for mediocre service. I tipped 15% which I'm sure is most than most people would have in that situation.\n\nIt's noteworthy that the bathrooms are tiny and hard to navigate for an ambulatory person of any size. Anyone requiring a cane, chair, or other ambulatory needs would be unable to utilize a restroom.\n\nIn summary: When serving patrons, a few moments make the difference in your pay. Pretend to care for 3 sentences worth of interactions at least.",

The yellowtail I had was exceptionally fresh\u2014so much so that the fish practically melted on my tongue.\n\nIt was an outstanding culinary experience. Overall, I would give FuGaKyu five stars for its setting and the quality of the food.\n\nThe only area for improvement was the communication with the female hostess, which felt a bit less welcoming, possibly due to a slight language barrier.\n\nDespite this, it did not detract significantly from the overall experience.\n\nI look forward to returning and enjoying more of what FuGaKyu has to offer.",

                "text": "Beautiful restaurant, Japanese interiors, coy pond and fountain, waitresses wearing kimonos, private booth. That adds a lot to the experience. We went there for dinner on a winter Saturday night, two couples.\n\nThe food was good and nicely plated, the prices were high but fair, considering the quality of the restaurant.\n\nThe main downside is the rush. It started with the revolving water fountain in the vestibule. Instead of flowing slowly to create a relaxing atmosphere, it revolves fast and gushes water loudly. Then in the booth, the waitress was in a hurry to take orders, to remove dishes even when not fully eaten, and to bring us the bill at the end. We paid and then stayed a bit longer to talk, we did not order dessert or tea since the check had been closed.\n\nI did not appreciate the wipes they serve with the meal. Those are very bad for the environment, not biodegradable. I'd rather use the napkins and wash my hands in the restroom.\n\nI understand they need to make money and clear tables, but when paying around $50 pr person- you want to enjoy and take your time.\nPerhaps it's more relaxed on weekdays.\n\nGood restaurant, enjoy !",

The tables are nice and there is a big walking space to move around.\n\nThe service is quick and good. They exchange the water bottles quite quickly, and the food comes out pretty fast.\n\nThe prices for the food is decently priced. The Korean BBQ does run a bit on the expensive side if you are a big eater, but the tteokbokki and appetizers are reasonably priced, even lower than other restaurants. The quality of the food is pretty good, and tastes quite well with the banchan. I would recommend the hot pot bibimbap, it isn't too hot when it arrives at the table but keeps the food warm, and it can form scorched rice at the bottom of the pot when done. The portion sizes for the korean bbq is good for a party of around 4-5.\n\nA majority of the tables are suited for parties of 4-6, I probably wouldn't come here with a party larger than 8.",

Comfy soup with glass noodles, flavorful soup, and soft beef. it so soft that even the tough part closest to the bone is soft. The side dishes are good too. Their seafood pancake is great. It's such a solid place every time I go. The owner is super nice too!",

When we asked about the portion, the server said it was their standard size due to the cost of short rib, but we\u2019ve had better quality and larger portions in other Boston Korean restaurants for less.\nWhile the rest of the food tasted good and reasonably portioned and the service was fine, the Kalbi beef was a total letdown.",

Early last year, I finally settled on this place and have been ordering from here at least once a month.\n\nThis isn't the place for the most extraordinary Korean cuisine you'll ever experience, but it reliably satisfies cravings with just the right balance of spices and authentic flavors. Although they specialize in Korean BBQ, I find myself drawn more to their Garden Specials and soup-based entr\u00e9es. The Gopchang Bokeum and Kimchi Stew are some of my favorites. These dishes capture the essence of Korean cooking with well-balanced spice levels and rich, satisfying sauces.\n\nThe portions are also quite generous for the price, so if you\u2019re looking for a good value Korean comfort meal, this is the place to go.",

This makes the dishes keep warm and retain the flavor longer.\n\nAlso, their service is also friendly and quick. Very impressive dining experience there.",

The taste of the food is consistent with their branch in North End, but the difference in serving size was quite distinct.\n\nThey serve a small loaf of bread as a starter. You can top it with parmesan cheese or dip it in olive oil, both of which are present on each table.My wife and I shared 2 half portions of Alfredo and Aglio Olio.\n\nThe aglio olio was fantastic. It comes with ground calamari. I recommend asking for the spicy vinegar and that to this dish.\n\nThe alfredo was good, but nothing mind-blowing. Make sure you order it with protein because it's a bit lacking without it. I wish we ordered it with scallops.\n\nOverall, it was a good experience. The server was great and accommodated special requests from a family of 4 that dined while we were there.",

I was able to stand back and watch this jewel of a place be ran. Felt like I was at my late Nona's house watching magic happen. When you can witness the hardwork and heart being put into a family owned buisness makes you want to jump in and help. The only issue I would just disrupt the play. I will make it a habit to visit this resteraunt every time I'm in town. Mad Mad respect to you guys!!!\nAlso, got the Lobster fra diavolo and Ceasar salad. Watched all the tables around each dish looked, smelled, and by their own words were awesome.\nSo real simple you in town go get you some Daily Catch.",

The chicken flavor I choose was yangnyeom, this is a new flavor for me I  really enjoyed it. The other flavor was spicy and I really enjoy the heat as well. The fries was very crispy and delicious. The fried rice was very flavorful me and my family enjoyed it all . The really special thing here is the fry chicken, the way they cook them is very unique I honestly don't know how they do it . I love it. I highly recommend this place especially for the Chicken wings..",

Also got some japchae and some pork buns. Been here a few times before. As always, the chicken is GREAT. Balanced between moist and dryness, soy garlic is flavorful. But the spicy one\u2026 I\u2019ll tell ya is where it is at. I have a high spice tolerance but this place always will make ya sweat. The thing is the taste of it is so addicting and you want more spice! The spice level is definitely much higher than the one in Lowell I\u2019ve been to. The japchae was decent. The pork buns were a bit dry and overcooked. The seasoned fries were a bit cold and mushy as well. That and the fact we didn\u2019t get the sides of radish, etc with our meal is the cause for the 4 stars and not five.",

The banchan (pictured here) was incredibly basic. Despite asking the waitstaff twice for a refill on the banchan, none was provided. Good luck getting any service here - besides dropping off the dishes and the check, no waitstaff came by and it was nearly impossible to get anyone\u2019s assistance.  The tofu soup was passable, seafood pancake was soggy, and beef bulgogi was too sweet. I would not come back. I\u2019d recommend you look into the many other great Korean restaurants in the area for better food and service.",

                "text": "I recently dined here during my vacation, and it was an unforgettable experience. I thought I had Italian food before, but nothing quite like this. \"Delicious\" doesn\u2019t even begin to cover it.\n\nOur server, Chris, was exceptional. He was very helpful and friendly. He took the time to help me find the perfect dish, accommodating my restriction of no alcohol. I ended up with a chicken dish stuffed with prosciutto, spinach, and red pepper in a Alfredo sauce paired with the best mushroom risotto. We also tried the gnocchi in red sauce, which was delightful. The texture of the gnocchi was soft and well balanced with the sauce.\n\nAs bonus points, the parking in the area was much more accessible than other parts of town where we found it impossible to park at during a holiday.\n\nThis place did not disappoint. We would 100% return to eat here again. If you\u2019re looking for an Italian cuisine and excellent service, this is the spot!",

We don\u2019t really eat out much anymore as we\u2019ve found food in Boston to be pretty lackluster, plain, and unseasoned, but not this place! We went after hearing a million recommendations, and it did not disappoint.\n\nWe were seated fast, and our server was friendly and on top of everything (she even switched to Spanish after hearing us speak it). There were people coming and going the whole time, so it\u2019s clearly popular, but not crowded or loud.\n\nEverything was so good, yet the definite highlight of the night was the Lasagna (it was the day\u2019s special, I\u2019m not sure how often they have it), it was heavenly from the very first bite. My husband is somewhat of a lasagna snob/aficionado, and he declared this lasagna as the best he\u2019s EVER had, and said it was the best meal he\u2019s had in Boston all these years. So that paints you a picture of how much we enjoyed our food.\n\nWould 1000% recommend it!",

The wait was just about 20 minutes for three ppl, after call-ahead wait-list (not reservation). It is extremely loud in the space, as well as cramped tabling, so if you\u2019re not a fan of a high decibel of ppl talking or being close in proximity to other patrons dining, you may wish to inquire about take-out. Server was friendly. Establishment was clean. Prices are insanely lesser than other restaurants that offer authentic Italian cuisine: $107 was our check for three entrees and two glasses of vino. Two in my party had house-made gnocchi with a red sauce. I had Veal Vitello Carlo, which is veal stuffed with artichoke hearts, prosciutto and Fontina cheese, in a plum tomato sauce with onions and mushrooms. Came with a couple potatoes and steamed broccoli. Was delicious! Highly recommend.",

Everything was about average, and nothing stood out as being great or bad. The empanadas were alright, but I personally didn't think the flavors were a great combination so I didn't see it as a great fusion dish. The steak tacos and steak tips were decent, but just didn't stand out in any way. The cauliflower had great spices, but the odd thing was that we only got five pieces of cauliflower, which feels like a small amount for a relatively cheap ingredient. Perhaps some of the other food or drinks I didn't try is better.\n\nService:\nThe service was great. We were checked on frequently and never waited very long for anything.",

I went after a book talk and they had plenty of seating (although it does get busy at 8 so make a reservation!). They mainly serve pizzas, both custom and with delicious toppings. I loved my hot honey, pepperoni, goat cheese one. They have tiramisu and cookies for dessert. Other than pizzas, they serve some entree options but it\u2019s not a place for diverse foods.\n\nOverall, the staff were very friendly and nice, albeit a little slow during dinner rush.

                "text": "Came in for an early morning breakfast. I ordered the \u201cKenmore\u201d a double egg sandwich with cheese, tomato and onions. I also ordered a croissant and a chai latte.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what I was expecting, but raw onions wasn\u2019t it. Luckily they were extremely easy to remove, indeed the biggest problem with the sandwich was that the eggs and the tomato were so slippery that both halves of the sandwich were basically constantly sliding around and threatening to fall apart as I ate it. I had to squeeze together the bagel and it was definitely an extremely tricky sandwich to eat.\n\nThe eggs, as far I could tell weren\u2019t seasoned, and neither were the tomatoes. That being said, the bagel was knockout and the sandwich overall left me satisfied.\n\nThe croissant tasted much better than it looked, very buttery (almost too buttery), but it was just clearly underbaked. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s always how they make their croissants but there was no flake, no golden brown crisp, anything. But again inside it had layers and the flavor was there.\n\nChai was better than average, though overly sweet.\n\nThere\u2019s barely any room in the shop itself so I enjoyed my breakfast outside. The service was also not great with another customer coming and bringing me my sandwich because they barely call out the order so even though I was standing feet away from the pick up counter I hadn\u2019t heard when they were finished. Same with the chai.\n\nSo I know that sounds like a lot of quibbles and they are. So why the four stars? Why not lower? Because this place is a bagel shop and it was clear that the bagels they offered were handmade freshly made and definitely the everything bagel I had was the highlight of my meal.\n\nIf I were to go back, I would only order a bagel with cream cheese, or grab bagels for a morning meeting. I think in some degree the restaurant should be judged by what they primarily do, and as a primary bagel place I thought the bagel was great.",

                "text": "I had heard from friends that Kupel's is one of the very few kosher restaurants in Boston, so I was looking forward to trying their offerings. The bakery was bustling around lunch time on a Sunday. The menu is quite fun -- each sandwich is an MBTA stop name colored as its respective MBTA line. But, as I experienced, perhaps the fun naming scheme leads to mixups in making the orders.\n\nI ordered the Hynes, which is supposed to have egg salad, lox, tomato, and onion. I ended up having tuna salad in my bagel sandwich instead. The tuna salad was pretty unremarkable. I liked the lox (wish there was more of it), and the bagel was fine. When we went back to ask for the egg salad, they kindly gave us a small tub of egg salad as a replacement. However, I didn't enjoy the egg salad either -- it was not creamy and the egg white pieces were very tiny.\n\nI also got the elephant ear pastry, which had some weird discolored speckles on it. One bite that I had tasted like mold, so I ended up tossing it. I wouldn't try their pastries again -- it doesn't seem like they're guaranteed to be fresh.\n\nOverall, Kupel's is a very affordable option with a wide array of bagel sandwich combination options. Perhaps too many options...my friend's order got mixed up as well -- it didn't have any of the ingredients it was supposed to have -- and I've heard of more mixups in the past. I think Kupel's is a very important establishment that caters to many dietary restrictions at a reasonable price, and the employees are very nice about making up for wrong orders, but based on my experiences, I probably would not come back. I definitely do not recommend trying the pastries...",

Our server grilled and cut our meats into bite sizes and was very attentive.\nEverything was delicious. We ordered fried oysters, which were crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside. For the main course, we went with the 2-person combo, which came with 2 meats and 2 side orders. We chose pork belly and marinated short ribs to be served along with kimchi stew and soybean stew. Taste-wise, everything was perfect. However, I wished the pork belly were thicker cut. This restaurant serves them bacon-thin. We also enjoyed all the side dishes which were well fermented and seasoned. We will definitely be coming back.",

The restaurant, with its clean, traditional Korean BBQ layout, exuded a welcoming vibe. While restaurant serving Korean and Japanese food under Chinese management might not sound appealing, the dishes I tried weren\u2019t too bad.\n\nAmong the menu I ordered, the Chicken Gizzard, with its mix of peppers, garlic, and sesame oil, stood out. The Kimchi Fried Rice, while slightly Americanized lacking that extra kick of tanginess typical in Korean cuisine, was still quite enjoyable. The prompt service, with all the dishes arriving in under ten minutes, added to the positive experience.\n\nKayuga might not be my first choice for authentic Korean comfort food, but it certainly is a reliable option for those seeking a quick Korean meal or a casual K-BBQ experience in the BU area.",

It\u2019s a very steep price for effectively just bread, and this has been happening consistently as I come here frequently. I\u2019m disappointed, I used to love this place\n\nGreat staff! Though I\u2019m never super impressed by the coffee here (somewhat watered down, but I\u2019m just particular) I love the bagels and sandwiches!! So grateful for all the vegan options :) I\u2019m sad there isn\u2019t more seating but they do the best they can with the small space",

My usual coffee order is the Maple Iced Latte with less milk which is not overly sweet or syrupy, has the perfect taste! It looks very light but doesn\u2019t taste overly watered down or milky. They roast their own coffee and it never tastes burnt. My favorite sandwich is The Fix on a plain bagel which is super flavorful and has a sweet and slightly spicy pepper jam that\u2019s made in house! Super flavorful and always flavorful. Service is quick and always friendly. On the weekends it\u2019s convenient to order ahead online because there\u2019s a line sometimes. They also offer delivery. Much more satisfying experience than at larger coffee chains!",

Several workers said that the Owner advised them to only add 3 lines. The owner didn't advise them how many inches were each line. At all other Mc Donalds, people are given the same vanilla ice cream for $2.99 plus tax a tall vanilla ice cream. Since the owner of this location cares so much not to have its own workers give everyone a tall ice cream cone. I am going to add other Mc Donalds locations in Boston, what other people get vs others, plus there mc donalds advertisement of 3 tall long ice cream cones for 2.99",

I ordered the \"surf and turf\" which in the menu the description says \"lobster & filet mignon\", and I specified medium rare for the steak. What comes to shock me was this. The steak was chopped and pan fried and way overcooked, and the seafood was several shrimps mixed with chopped lobster meat. This is blatant misrepresentation and deserves a more official complaint/report. To make matters worse, a 18% tip was automatically added to the bill without my consent. I've never experienced something Iike that for a 2-person dinner. I'm sure this place would die pretty quickly if it weren't for the hotel vouchers which could only be spent here.",

After a long day, we decided to try this restaurant as it was conveniently situated in the hotel we were staying in.\n\nThe restaurant is large with 4 or 5 hibachi tables at the center of the room and standard seating around the perimeter. At 7pm on Friday night, we were one of three standard tables seated. Our waitress seemed to be in a rush to turn over our table and get us to leave. I will say that the other staff we encountered were delightful.\n\nThe food and drinks were disappointing, to say the least. Most flavors were off-putting, especially the dressing included with the house salad. It had a strong vinegar taste which overpowered the rest of the ingredients. Unfortunately, the drinks were very weak. One thing I really did enjoy was the Black Widow Roll; it was beautifully presented, tasted fresh, and I loved the added crunch of the sweet potato. Our bill was high and while I don't mind paying for good quality, I think Bisuteki was overpriced for what we were served.\n\nI would recommend dining at another sushi restaurant in the area as they are easy to find.",

                "text": "Bad quality drinks.\n\nI like the baristas here a lot but I face a scenario of having to either ask -- almost every time -- to have my drink remade, or to accept a cappuccino whenever I order a no-foam or low-foam latte. Again, nice baristas, but the amount of foam I get within each beverage is enough to make this place a two-star establishment at best. When you're paying $7+ for a drink and tipping multiple dollars, but only getting about 50% of the drink actually in the cup, over and over again... Really frustrating! I genuinely don't understand why these baristas don't use the foam spoon like every other Starbucks in the country.\n\nEDIT: As nice as the owner was, and again, as nice as the baristas are... This just keeps happening. Attaching a new pic of my tall no-foam oatmilk latte. This is a cappucino: half foam. I am going down to 1 star because I was once a former barista myself at a Starbucks for years and I know how easy it is to just use a spoon to hold back foam when someone orders a no-foam latte. This is legitimately robbing customers of 50% of their beverage or more, and it happens almost every single time to this day.\n\nEDIT 2  to add that, 7 months later, this problem is still occurring and may have actually gotten worse. As a former barista for years who worked at a Starbucks on Newbury St., I know what it's like to work in a very busy store. There's no excuse for repeatedly giving me half a cup of foam on a no-foam latte.  Am I going to have to resort to Dunkin full time!?",

                "text": "Victoria's Seafood is a late night spot open until around 1 AM on most days, meaning it is a great place to grab a quick bite or dinner after a night out. It's near BU and sees a lot of international students on the weekends or during late nights.\n\nThe service is very quick here and fast-paced, which may turn people off if they're expecting a fine dining sort of service. It definitely helps if you speak Mandarin or Cantonese, as most of the other wait staff do not speak English or have trouble with the language.\n\nI have ate many things off this menu, ranging from the Beef Kebabs, Lobster Sauce, Fish Maw Soup, Salt & Pepper Squid, Beef Satay Chow Foon, and much more. The prices have risen over the years, but it is still a good portion for the price. The food quality has been very good, and whenever I order take-out the food is still fresh and not soggy by the time I get it.\n\nI would recommend this place for catering as well, as the portion size is pretty good and price is decent for larger parties. Overall a wonderful place to eat at or order takeout from.",

My friend and I decided to try it ourselves yesterday and it was the best decision of my entire Friday! The food is fresh and delicious, I got the Tempura tteokboki and my friend got the kimchi stew. Everything was gorgeous and the service was attentive and impeccable. We had the best time ever sitting here drinking beer and watching music videos, and my only regret was that I got too full to finish my food!! I highly recommend Myung Dong.",

We walked in, two adults and a toddler, on a Friday night and at first was a little hesitant like, hmm this is kind of a drinking place. But we had a great time! It was fun to people watch and reminisce about our college days! And our toddler enjoyed the videos and the waitress very kindly gave him a treat on the way out. Great place all around!",

Not being a fan of animal intestines, the reviews from other patrons gave a 3.5 \ud83c\udf1f for that bowl; but the military bowl was pretty subpar, no much veggies, the spam was over cooked, and missing some ingredients I had in other Korean restaurant with the same bowl. The rice cake and tofu was tasty, that earned a 4 \u2b50\ufe0f.\n\nOne more thing, this is the first Korean restaurant where we only received 3 small dishes accompanied with our dishes. Usually it\u2019s between 5-10 dishes per order. Much improvements can be done on that front.\n\nStaff were friendly and place was clean. I wouldn\u2019t be going back for the second time given the pierce competition of Korean restaurants in the area.",

Maybe lower the volume a little bit and that\u2019ll be better.\n\n[Okay so here\u2019s the update. I went there 3 more times after I wrote this review and found they did adjust the music style and the volume so it\u2019s comfortable now.]\n\nThe prices match its value, hot pots are good for cold winter. However, the seasoning of many dishes are quite the same style, you may want to have some refreshing drinks to refresh your tastes.",

The sauces were very flavorful and it was stuffed. I also ordered some sauce on the side, but it looks like I got all three as part of the fries or wrap. The garlic and spicy garlic are amazing but the harissa seems to have too much black pepper in it.\n\nFries were a large portion and baklava and grape leaves were what you'd expect. Thought the delivery was fast and very well packaged.",

They could not deliver for cash, so I agreed to pick it up. They called back to say the choice I made was not available. I changed my choice, and gave them a credit card number and they agreed to deliver it in 30 minutes.\n\n60 minutes later, I called because nothing had arrived. I was told \"it's not my fault\" but the fault of Doordash, who \"didn't come.\" I pointed out that since they offer pizza delivery, it WAS  \"their fault.\" They said they could call Doordash again. I said I wanted a hot fresh pizza. They said I could get a refund instead, 75 minutes after the original call. I said I wanted a hot pizza, and was told several times \"I want you to see MY point of view.\"\n\nFed up, I asked for a refund, and asked to speak to the manager. I was on hold for several minutes, as had happened at least 3 times already: (\"just give me a second\"). Finally, I called back, and was told the manager was not there until tomorrow, and would refund me then. \"Why didn't you tell me that to start with?!\" \"We are busy.\"\n\nThen I was on hold for another two minutes, and gave up.\n\nDon't try delivery from here!",

Ordered some garlic parmesan wings and it was just wings with minced garlic on it. Not in a sauce. Not roasted garlic. Nearly raw, minced garlic, sitting on the side of the wings.  And no cheese. The Pizza was OK but a little sad. It was definitely more floppy and a little bit wet than normal. The buffalo wings were alright if not a little dry, somehow like the garlic parmesan. Oddly enough the best thing was the salad. Maybe this is just kind of a one off. But for 50+ dollars can\u2019t say I\u2019m thrilled.",

I got my order just minutes after I had ordered (with the way the menu is set up I figured they make sure to have enough of the different components of the various combos ready to plate).\nThe chicken was crispy and pretty moist but if you feel that it is a little dry the cane sauce more than fixes it and it's the bomb. The fries aren't half bad. Texas toast is really good. And if you ordered something like the box combo you should definitely make a sandwich(I had seen a YouTuber do it and they were not kidding) with the toast, a chicken finger, coleslaw (I liked that the vegetables were minced and works well for a mini sandwich), sauce and even fit in some fries if you can.\nI suggest going here if you want something that is a step up from fast food joints like McDonald's or Burger King",

The cashier even saved me a few bucks by suggesting I get the combo instead of ala cart orders.  It takes a little while because they make your sushi to order, but this time it was definitely worth the wait.",

We got the basil chicken, the appetizer with seaweed, egg, and tofu, the popcorn chicken over rice, the braised beef soup, and pork and bamboo. They were literally all equally delicious, and amazing! We finished almost everything. The waiters were so polite and apologetic when they forgot the rice. They checked on us during our meal and the atmosphere was great overall. I would recommend their chicken.",

I frequented Dolphin Bay back when they were in Southern California and was so sad when they closed. I had no idea I\u2019d find them here! What a stroke of luck and a crazy coincidence. There\u2019s only one Dolphin Bay, and they\u2019re family-owned. So if you\u2019re in Boston, definitely check it out for some authentic Taiwanese food!\n\nNow onto the food!\n\nThe pork chop bento was a classic. It was pricey, but for the amount of pork chop you get, it makes sense. There was so much they even put the extra in a paper bag with a handwritten note, which I appreciated.\n\nYou can also buy the lu rou (braised ground pork) in bulk on the side! It makes an amazing topping for rice.\n\nI ordered to-go and I was very impressed with the packaging. They bagged everything separately to ensure nothing would spill and put the extra pork chop in a paper bag to prevent it from getting soggy. I appreciate them being mindful of how to pack their food for maximum freshness. Not many restaurants have learned to do that.\n\nThe milk tea is solid. Nothing out of this world, but it tastes like nostalgia and satisfies my craving.\n\nThis has been a comfort spot since I was a kid, and I will definitely be back.",

The food, for what it is (elevated fast food), is great value for money - it tastet delicious and hits the sweet spot, at least for me. I also like it way better than Coreanos or Kimchi Papi.\n\nWould highly recommend for a quick bite or a take -out. Only went to sit-in once and it was not super pleasant inside.",

They had gobi manchurian (fried gobi in some ketchup and other sauces and spices) chicken and paneer tikka masala, aaloo choley (chickpea), plain rice,  carrot potatoes, sambhar and masala dosa, chiken tikka, kheer, gulabjamun, chai. (The garlic naan are not unlimited, you have to pay after the first one)\n\nEverything just looks good but lacks flavor. I checked the images of their food (that look good) but lacks flavor on the contrary.\nThe chai had spices that were overpowering. Sambhar tasted nothing but lentil daal with water and boiled veggies. (See image)\nGobi Manchurian is not good either.\n\nOn top of this, their manager was so rude. (The waiting staff is kind though). We entered 20 minutes before the buffet was closing. We took everything at once because the manager informed us about closing buffet. But he was very uncourteous and eager to wrap things up. One of the waiting staff was heading to us to ask if we want something more (he asked the same on other table). He was stopped by the manager saying \u201cthey are done\u201d. The food isn\u2019t nice, the manager is rude. I am not going there again just for the atmosphere.",

But what I do know is, if I\u2019m hungry and craving some of what American calls \u201cIndian food\u201d, this is the place I\u2019m going. Tastes delicious, they always ask me what spice level I want my food. They used to have a buffet, and then shut it down during the COVID-19 pandemic due to obvious sanitary precautions and for the safety of all their customers! Every time I\u2019ve come to dine here, I\u2019m either the only one there or there are one or two other dining parties, which again, I\u2019m not a bit fan of experiencing that, but that doesn\u2019t change the truth of how good the food is! The portions are relatively small. I can handle a lot of spice when I ask for spicy food, they still have never crafted that much of a spicy dish for me, I hope one day they do, but that\u2019s a personal preference! I also absolutely appreciate the kind service the staff provide. They are welcoming and hospitable and make it comfortable enough to not make it feel like they are all watching you eat as your the only one there! Try it. You find out you will be pleased! You\u2019ll find I posted two pictures! One with food in the plates/bowls, one shows empty plates/bowls. Yes! Every single bite is delicious! You won\u2019t want to leave a single grain of rice behind!",

The food was quite good: the spicy tuna kimbap had a nice kick, the bulgogi rice was flavorful and tender, and the dumpling soup was both hearty and satisfying. The cold chewy noodles were refreshing, and the bibimbap sauce had a good level of spice. While it may not be the best Korean food I've ever had, it's definitely a solid spot for authentic Korean cuisine.",

The servers are quick and are very knowledgeable about the menu, I believe it is a family business so they understand all the parts. The food comes out quite fast, within 20 minutes of us ordering.\n\nThe food is really good, one of my favorites in the area. I got the combo meal, which came with the soup, tteokbokki, and kimbap. It was priced reasonably and came with good portion sizes. The kimbap has a nice consistency, and for the price you get a lot of it. The tteokbokki had a nice kick to it but wasn't overly spicy, and the fish cake soup had a nice healthy and clean taste to it.\n\nA great place that I will return to again.",

Their sushi is not weighed down with seaweed and you can taste the fish. (For the norms)\n\nEverything they do is perfect.\n\nFish is properly done, you will not find their quality anywhere in Boston. This is fact, with over 600 sushi restaurants across the globe, it no longer becomes an opinion.\n\nSo how they do it? They work and massage the fish. Most restaurants don't have time or wages to do this. They marry the taste correctly, really better than anything I've ever tasted.\n\nTheir employees are friendly and comfortable. They come to work to serve amazing food. You don't need to look amazing to do this. They do a great job at keeping the importance of the food.\n\nEnjoy their hot sake, enjoy their food.",

Staff is always very friendly and it\u2019s a great place to go as a group. You can try multiple rolls\nWithout breaking the bank. Also, if you do go alone the rolls are reasonably priced as well.\n\nI\u2019ve tried most of their menu and they never disappoint. Checkout the photos below and ask for the flaming sushi, it\u2019s great for show!\n\nFresh fish and hot sake = great time and happy bellies",

                "text": "My friend and I came here looking for some Korean style sushi. While their menu was limited than I initially expected, we were able to find the spicy fish bowl soup which is a popular dish in Korea during the summer. The bowl came with an icy cold broth and vegetables that enhanced the refreshing aftertaste. The classic combination of thinly sliced squid and the sweet and spicy broth was nice, but the broth was too sweet for my taste. We also had the regular sushi and the scallop yaki, but both were unfortunately mediocre at best.\n\nWithout AC, the restaurant was extremely hot and humid. The servers tried their best to provide us with a table closest to a fan, but it was pointless. Humidity and temperature are also critical factors in maintaining the quality of the sushi, so it was a bit concerning. We were also hugely disappointed when we found out that some items on the menu were more expensive than what was indicated. The fish bowl soup ended up being $10 more expensive, and we didn\u2019t realize this until we got out. Although I would love to give a higher rating for their superb service, the overall experience wasn\u2019t worth what I paid for.",

Don't come here thinking it's a grandeur building because it isn't. It's small and homey but the sushi is worth it. Service was good - didn't hover and explained which rolls were placed where on the plate. We did have to ask for a water refill but it is one person serving/greeting/seating and he had a lot going on between others dining in and picking up take out so, give some grace! Miso soup is given complimentary when you are seated. It had a great flavor, a little room temperature but the tofu was cooked just right. We had the Red Dragon, Oppa Maki, Tornado Maki and Rainbow. The Tornado and Rainbow were our favorites! Their sake was light and mild, which I really liked (and I'm not a Sake fan). Reasonably priced sushi for being in Boston, averaged $30/person for our meal. If you're looking for somewhere low-key and has quality, check out Oppa!",

Right when you are sat down they bring complimentary miso soup for the table, and as someone who is normally not a big fan, i thoroughly enjoyed it.

The menu is massive, so be sure to take time to soak it all in.\n\nIf you love Chinese food, they have you covered. You\u2019ll find a huge selection of starters and dim sum. They have a large selection of soups- such as Wonton, Hot and Sour, Miso, and more! They do have salads on their menu as well!\n\nFor the main course, they have a massive selection of Chinese favorites. You\u2019ll find classics like beef and broccoli and happy family. They have multiple preparations of dishes made with shrimp, beef, and/or chicken. There truly is something for everyone.\n\nThe portion size is LARGE. You can easily split an entree. Otherwise, the rest makes solid leftovers! Be aware the entrees DO NOT come with rice if you order delivery.\n\nIf you are leaning more towards Japanese, you won\u2019t be disappointed! You\u2019ll find a solid selection of starters such as edamame, shrimp and vegetable tempura, spring rolls, gyoza, and more!\n\nJin\u2019s has a solid selection of fresh sushi. You\u2019ll find a wide selection of fresh sashimi and nigiri. If you like maki rolls, they\u2019ve got something for you! They offer everything from a basic California roll to an exquisite $20+ maki roll.\n\nThey offer multiple sushi combos, sushi plates, and samplers. If you plan to dine in with multiple people, they do have a \u201cboat\u201d of sushi with sashimi and other assorted sushi.\n\nWe stopped into Jin\u2019s on a late Sunday afternoon before the dinner rush. The atmosphere is modern, relaxing, and peaceful. You can dine in the main dining room, or you can park yourself at the sushi bar if you\u2019re coming solo.\n\nWe started with an order of the Wonton Soup. The soup came out piping hot and the aroma of the broth was incredible! The wontons were incredible as well. They were the perfect size.\n\nNext, we decided to order some steamed edamame with lime and the \u201cBeijing Ravioli\u201d. The edamame were steamed and salted perfectly. I strongly suggest a generous squeeze of lime over the top!\n\nThe Beijing Ravioli is some of the best I have had in a long time. I would compare them to a traditional pork \u201cpotsticker\u201d. They were pan-fried to perfection, not too greasy. The dipping sauce served with it hits just right!\n\nAfter the Beijing Ravioli and the Steamed Edamame, we decided to order the Seared Ahi and the \u201cSnow Mountain Maki\u201d. They both were incredibly fresh and flavorful.\n\nThe Seared Ahi tuna was seared perfectly and served in a mustard sauce. The portion size was phenomenal for the price! The \u201cSnow Mountain Maki\u201d is a shrimp tempura roll topped with king crab and mayonnaise.\n\nI\u2019d highly suggest Jin\u2019s if you\u2019re a fan of Chinese and Japanese cuisine. The sushi is phenomenal and reasonably priced for the portion size and quality of ingredients.\n\nI\u2019d recommend dining in if you can. The service is incredibly attentive and the food does come out QUICK. If you like to eat at a slower pace like I do, just stagger your orders appropriately.\n\nThey do offer delivery in-house and via UberEats/DoorDash. I noticed they do a TON of delivery and takeout orders. Everything is always packed incredibly well and all the condiments and accoutrements are in the bag. They always get it right!\n\nMy only complaint would be the dessert menu. I found it to be very disappointing. I would suggest they offer mochi or something more fit to the cuisine.",

                "text": "One of my favorite spots in Allston for lunch specials.\n\nBeen coming here for lunch whenever I\u2019m running errands in the area. While trendy new Chinese restaurants are constantly popping up in Allston, Dumpling Kingdom offers classic Chinese lunch specials that transport me back to simpler times. Forget the flashy newcomers. This unassuming restaurant consistently satisfies my cravings at unbeatable prices.\n\nTheir lunch specials feature over 20 items, each accompanied by a complimentary side of egg drop soup and white rice. Some of my favorites include the Mala Spicy Flounder Fillet and Twice Cooked Pork. The flounder fillet, with its perfect balance of heat and tender meat, is one of the best I've had in Boston. Other dishes I've tried, like Beef with Scallions, Salt and Pepper Pork Chops, and Taiwanese Pork Belly, were also solid.\n\nI've also tried two of their dumplings and particularly enjoyed the Mini Juicy Buns with Pork & Crabmeat. While the umami of the fillings wasn't completely satisfying, these buns were packed with a good amount of pork juice\u2014so much so that my first bite splashed all over my shirt.\n\nDespite this amazing lunch special deal, the restaurant doesn\u2019t get crowded during lunchtime, so I highly recommend giving them a try.",

The filet fish soup with sour cabbage (has vermicelli noodles underneath) is very light and perfect for a cold night. The pork belly was very tender and flavorful. The Kung pao chicken had a nice kick but not too spicy. Dining area closes at 10pm but take out goes until midnight.\nStaff is friendly and attentive. Food comes out quick, so if you don't want everything too come out at once, then don't order all at once.",

                "text": "Decent option for Mediterranean fast food in Allston.\n\nTook a couple of visits while looking for a quick meal in the area. The restaurant was mostly empty during my visits, so it was somewhat disappointing to find out that they used pre-carved meats for the Shawarma plate. The kebab plate was served with a made-to-order grilled chicken, so it seemed like the vertical spits, adorned with stacks of beef and chicken, were just there as decorations. While limited in numbers, their sides and salad options were great, but the meats were generally on the drier end.\n\nIn terms of pricing, Garlic N Lemons positions itself at the higher end compared to other kebab joints in the city, such as Aceituna. However, the quality of the food, particularly the meats, doesn't notably surpass its competitors. While it may be a solid option in Allston, I\u2019m not sure if I would return.",

The tastes were there, the veggies tasted fresh and the sauces/dips were really tasty as well (especially the spicy garlic one).\nMy personal preference was spicy beef, as the chicken was not as great, but that might just be a question of preference. Still, although the meat was precut and loaded to plates from the tray (a little disappointment), it still tasted pretty good.\n\nService: Communication was a little messy, since the place was almost empty, but it was fast.\n\nAmbiance: It's nothing special. Everytime I pass it by it's half empty, so I assume many people order take out. It's definitely not a place for a date, but for what it is - it's great!",

Drinks: The Avenue Bar take on the Negroni is both overpriced and an affront to the senses. Overly sweet and very medicinal. Why messing up a good thing? The Espresso Martini? Bland and watery, with about as much kick as a soggy napkin. I also tried the chips and Buffalo chicken dip. The chips were so old, bland and tough, they could have doubled as a new kind of dental torture. The Buffalo chicken dip was a sorry excuse for flavor, more of a ghost of Buffalo chicken than the real deal. Save yourself the agony and find somewhere else to dine.",

They have an online waitlist but you have to be present and ready to order when your name is called. It's quite efficient, which makes sense for a small restaurant with a lot of business!\n\nThe best thing I tried was the original chicken karaage -- it was super crispy and juicy with a wonderful ginger flavor. I also tried the extra crispy karaage, which I thought was not as good as the original because it wasn't as juicy. You can get takeout of just the chicken from their sister shop nearby, which I can definitely envision myself doing in the future.\n\nI got the spicy shoyu ramen which was very striking in appearance -- a very bright red-orange. It had a good savory and spicy flavor, but I'm not sure if I'd get it again. It was a bit one note.\n\nI tried a bit of the other ramens that we got and my favorite was the Gantetsu shoyu. It had a thicker broth with a deep smoky flavor. I'm not sure if I could finish an entire bowl of that richness, but that was definitely the most interesting one we tried! The other shoyu and shio ramens we got were pretty standard.\n\nI'm not ready to say that Ganko Ittetsu is one of my favorite ramen places yet, but it's worth a visit just for the karaage...",

                "text": "We've been coming here for years now, and we have not been disappointed at all by this spot. It is consistently one of our favorite ramen spots to travel to and eat or get take-out at.\n\nThey currently have a summer deal going on for 3 Gyozas with any ramen, which is a good steal considering the price of the gyoza is nearly triple the price for what they are offering. We decided to dine-in today, rather than get take-out. They take your orders before you are seated, which allows you to get the ramen decently fast after seating.\n\nI typically order the Gankara Miso, but this time I tried the TanTan style. It was nice and creamy, with a little bit of spice but not overwhelming. The noodles were soft and chewy, and the additional toppings helped to elevate the dish. I also got the gyoza, which came with a ponzu sauce that was a little sweet but very savory. The price is average for a ramen establishment, and they do offer add-ons that may start adding up to your total, but are worth adding. I added extra noodles and crunchy garlic, which helped use most of the remaining broth after I finished my bowl.\n\nThe only downside of this location is the amount of tables it has. It has consistently grown, including now some \"outdoor\" seating for the establishment, but we saw many people get turned away or told the wait was going to be very long for a table. I probably wouldn't ever come here with a party larger than 4 people, as you will have to wait a decent amount of time to be seated.",

They all seemed confused, looking at a pizza for about 4 minutes talking about it. It was weird...\n\n3 stars for the food. Keep in mind that I only ordered an XL Pizza.\n\nI ordered a $25 (Supposid) \"XL\" Pepperoni \"Lovers\" pizza.\n\nOkay, I got a 14-inch pizza? A normal large pizza anywhere else is 16 inches... how is this pizza an XL???\n\nOKAY, OKAY, price and size aside... I was nothing special... it had a chewy crust on one side and crispy in random places.\n\nLet's talk about the \"Pepperoni Lovers\" part of this... I took a picture for you to decide.  But... my opinion this did not look up to its meaning... it had an Average amount of Pepperoni...\n\nTo the owners of this shop... I watched so much mo ey walk out the door for people looking for slices.  While I stood there, I counted 18 people walk out the door in the time it took for you to make my pizza.\n\nStart selling SLICES... You're in a College Frat house neighborhood.  You're losing out on sooo much business.",

My husband had poached egg with salmon with a potato base toast. it was called the Empire. When you come in, you\u2019ll be pleasantly surprised to see all of the desserts at the countertop.

Our only notes were more salad and less chicken please :) Now, let\u2019s start talking about the sides\u2026 Hands down the best fries we\u2019ve ever had and the potato salad is the second best after my own kitchen. We would like to award extra point for the pickle accompaniment on the plate. The price for one is $15, I\u2019ll say before you all can\u2026 it\u2019s a steal!!! Long story short, if you want to feel at home and eat delicious food go to our local favorite spot and have a blast!",

Got a call around 10 minutes later from Jen checking in about specifics about the allergy (if cross-contamination would be a problem, and even let us know about which specific ingredients were officially allergen-free) and was so kind and helpful. It really made the night of the person with allergies. Thank you, Jen :-)",

Other spots definitely try to cut corners but PV sets a high standard and delivers\n\nTheir Banh Mi\u2019s are outstanding. I usually order the cold cut but my gf loves the grilled pork. Great pate and the bread that shatters everywhere if you try to eat it while driving (this is a good sign btw)\n\nOther musts are the cold chicken salad, shrimp fresh spring rolls with peanut sauce, and spicy beef noodle stew.\n\nThis family deserves your business",

                "text": "Very NewYork-esk. We got there by bycicle. I do recommend to have a locking cable for your bicycle(s) once you get there. Across the street theres a parkin lot, but I dont know if it belonges to the Japense place across the street. Thaitations is hole on the wall kind of spot. With great service and even greater tasty food. We actually saw Asian people in the back cooking the food. Lol. BUT the place does need more love and restoring, to make the bathrooms and ceiling, at least, more appealing to the eye. People nowadays take pictures whereever they go these days, specially where they go eating, and I, as a tourist, like to go to places where not only the food and service is great, but also the ambiance. Which is the reason why I gave this place 3\u2b50\ufe0f for atmosphere... Now, the food and service deserves 5\u2b50\ufe0f. The people who attended us were fast in acknowledging our presence as soon as we went inside, (you jave to pull the doors a bit hard due to some positive air pressure inside), and giving us a table and menu. The menu has plenty of choices. All delicious choices. Including vegan. I liked that they go into detail about all the ingredients for each choice. \u26a0\ufe0fCAUTION: if you don't like spicy food, or spicy food doesn't sit well with you, this is not your style of cuisine. But if you do like spicy, you'll find this is AMAZING FOOD. I ordered the Roasted  Duck Curry. It came in a ceramic pot. The presentation was excellent and the flavors even better. Accompanied with white rice that I poured inside the pot. And enjoyed with water and an Iced Lemon Tea. Let me tell you about this tea. It is amazing. Sure, it is a bit steep in price for iced tea. But it is worth it. It felt like I was drinking a medicinal, refreshing, tasty elixir. If someone can remake this drink and add vodka in it. It would be the sensation of the party. I also had a coffee \u2615\ufe0f (which they served in a ceramic cup. I hate it when I am served hot drinks at a restaurant in a foam cup). So I really liked that.) And for dessert I had the Vanilla Fried Ice cream. Imagine the flavor of a warm crunchy donut, with sesame seeds and honey on it, with the insides of a cold vanilla icecream...yeah...I know.",

Sausage egg donut came out cold , almost frozen . Then they just add more ( and colder) caramel to your latte which makes your latte undrinkable , unless you want to go back home and warm it up\u2026..\nGood store, good location, nice employees but organization is a mess . What about if more skilled people were hired and ( probably ) with a really good salary ???\nNever here anymore , on my side \u2026",

I literally thought they were acting that slow and lackadaisical as a joke. But no, they were just that lazy and really didn't give a flying f**k. The line behind me of medical professionals and city workers was out the door. The woman behind the counter just did not give two sh**s.\n\nI don't even know what else to say or how to articulate the rest of my experience. There was a spilled drink on the floor the entire time I was there. God only knows how long it was actually there for. The place was filthy and reeked of stale fecal matter.

They treat their vendors like guests (sadly, a rare occurrence to be treated like a human, let alone have the staff serve you multiple courses then COOKIES for dessert) and Chelsea is the BEST coordinator there. Harvard Club couples get the absolute best service, photo ops, location, all it!\n\nIf you're looking for a grand, luxurious downtown Boston venue, don't skip The Harvard Club!",

This leads to an uneven distribution of spread. In the photo below, I walked for ~10 mins to allow the spread to melt and give a chance to even out and melt before taking the picture. Faulty methodology is evident where one side of the bagel is dripping in butter while the other contains dry spots. Adding spread yourself is challenging when stopping in on a morning commute. The service is also not expedited enough to justify this methodology. I've been here a few times and noticed the method of only applying spread to one side and smashing together is routine and not a once-off.\n\nFor the price point, the expectation would be for staff to apply light spread/butter to both halves. The location is very convenient.",

                "text": "This was a good place to grab a bite after traveling. It is a food court. There were about 8 fast food places on site many of which were not open. Some I recognized like McDonald's but most I had never heard of. Most selections were rather greasy which happens to not be my preference. There were some kids running around unattended. They didn't bother me much but I could see this could be an issue. There is also a restaurant called the Longwood. That likely has a higher quality food. As someone looking for a quick bite after long business travel I wasn't inclined to sit around and wait. My experience was late afternoon on a Sunday. It was rather dead. So too the lack of shops around on the street surprised me. I would expect more with do many companies so close. So all in all it was very convenient but the quality and selection of food was not great. It's a good place for kids so they can walk around instead of being confined. It's a good option for quick take out of the typical fried food variety,  or if you don't mind the food court atmosphere one might expect in a shopping mall. I did not see any other stores. Note it is also at the level above the hotel check in. It was not obvious how one would enter from the street. I got there from the attached hotel. I would not have known it was there from the street. All in all I was glad it was there. I probably would have opted for a sandwich or bagel instead if such a shop had been located on the block,  and I probably would have chosen open air dining or a place where kids were not running around playing while I was trying to prepare for a business meeting.",

Until later this evening pre-surgery nerves had me walking around after hours and the food court was RUNNING with large mice. I have several videos showing at least 20-30 mice running and scattering across counters, tables, climbing up the glass food cases, etc as I walked through the court. They were literally everywhere. I\u2019ve never seen anything like this. This review is only allowing images to be uploaded, but videos will be shared with management. I\u2019d never eat from any of the establishments in that food court again. This definitely was unsettling and not an ideal \u201clast meal\u201d before having brain surgery. I typically hope that the places I\u2019m eating at are sanitary.",

Don't bother with the cheesecake which was meh.. no complaints overall though given it's the only (cheap) deal in town, bang opposite to the MFA.. and godsent on a cold and windy late night!",

The cheese pizza is my favorite so far. Didn't have a great experience with Popeye. The chicken tasted weird to me, Probably because I'm used to Indian cuisine and the Chicken is seasoned properly, Burger 373 has a better Chicken patty, but wished the patty was fried like it was in MC Donald or Burger King. I don't think I'll try Chicken burger in here again",

This is pretty impressive because of the huge volume of customers. During school time they get so many customers and queues can be as long as 30 people  so I think it is pretty impressive they remember me.",

I was pleasantly surprised by the portions and the flavor of the sauce. This is my second time coming here and I got the chicken teriyaki with fried rice. The sheer amount of chicken you get is a great value. The chicken also has a wonderful sear on the outside, giving it extra flavor while remaining tender. The fried rice also has great texture and flavor with plenty of crispy bits mixed in. I am going to be coming here regularly from now on.",

And a Nutella latte, because I could not resist ... also good. The decor is old black and white photos and posters which enhance feeling of France; the music vibes like 60s and 70s French music. I was here just after they opened on a Monday and there was plenty of seating. A few folks got things to go, all orders were dealt with quickly. Worth it for the crepes, the whimsy in some titles of menu items.\n\nThis also seemed like a place the neighborhood liked (I was only visiting).",

More of a thin pancake than any crepe I\u2019d ever had. The onions were undercooked, and by itself it looked lonely on the plate with two useless orange slices as the only\nGarnish. For the price, you can get full breakfast options, elsewhere and I found the craftsmanship rather basic and unremarkable.\n\nThe restaurant is cozy or cramped depending on how charitable you\u2019re feeling, and I felt bad sitting by myself as the only places to sit at were tables for four. Crepes are notoriously not a finger food.\n\nI\u2019m wondering if I got an off day or something, because if there\u2019s one thing you except a crepe place to excel at it\u2019s\u2026 the crepe itself.

But it\u2019s a solid place with some really great and fun dishes and it\u2019s consistent.\nMy favorites so far - eggplant tofu stir fry, pad krapow, pad thai Thai style (slightly more expensive but totally worth it!), Indonesian fried rice with fried chicken, vegetable Ruam Mit with tofu, and Rod D noodle (tastes a bit like pad see Wu but with thinner noodle). I like the service. It\u2019s also great that the cute dessert place Oasit\u2019s is right next door! (Their honey toast and Oreo croffle are yummy.)\n(FYI, their Pad kee mao and curry are not my favorites. And the spicy crispy calamari was also just ok..too sweet for my taste). Their menu is huge, so it\u2019s fun to go with friends.",

Good to have someone to point the way: we ordered the Pad Kra Pao (Hot Basil Thai style fried ground pork with white rice), the Bar Mee Rad Nar (Crispy yellow noodles with vegetables and Thai style gravy) and Indonesian fried rice with crispy chicken). These were served in huge portions! We topped our orders with Tropical Thai tea and Thai milk tea, and for dessert, a Banana with sweet sticky rice. The Pad Kra Pao was spicy, but refreshing after days of non-Asian food. Definitely recommend the Indonesian fried rice as it was flavourable with just the right amount of spiciness and spices. The crispy noodles was done Thai style and it would one to taste the Hongkong equivalent to make a fair judgement. We would have prefer the mango with sticky rice, but mangoes not in season (according to owner). Overall, the experience was good! Definitely should not miss this if you are in the Boston Cambridge area.",

Glad I went with her words because the food tasted amazing. They have such a big menu of dishes that other Thai places don\u2019t have. Hence it\u2019s authentic, expect the food to be real spicy (even with 1 chili sign).\n\nThe service by far is the fastest I\u2019ve seen in a sit down restaurant. We got our food within 10 minutes after ordering and they\u2019re freshly cooked. Highly recommend if in the Brookline area.",

Scallion pancake had a perfect balance between crispiness and chewiness and was also flavorful.\n\nThe spicy crispy chicken was also actually spicy and I would equate it to a medium spice level. Although it probably wouldn\u2019t be enough for someone who likes really spicy stuff, it was perfect for my needs. Chicken was also not overbattered and there was a large ratio of protein to batter, so you actually get your moneys worth.\n\nAll in all, Rod Dee is a Brookline classic and I highly recommend it!",

I got an Empanada Verde and Orinoco Mojito to start, a mixed salad and Parrilla Caraque\u00f1a for my main, and Quesillo for dessert. I stray away from mojitos because of sweetness but I figured to give it a chance and I wasn\u2019t disappointed. It had the right balance and one of my favorite mojitos I\u2019ve ever had. The empanada had me wishing I ordered more. The main entree was excellent, hats off to the kitchen staff. The chicken, steak, chorizo, and yuca fries cooked to perfection. The flavor/seasonings were balanced, and didn\u2019t beg of anything else (sauces, etc.). I usually don\u2019t go for dessert but I\u2019d say the quesillo would be a dessert to treat yourself to. Lastly, the service was incredible. Very warm, attentive, and informative, Philip and Daniel are what made the experience for me, and are the reason I will return. Highly recommend, you won\u2019t regret giving Orinoco a try. I\u2019m looking forward to trying out more of their menu.",

They're also very generous with the pesto and chicken. Couldn't finish the sandwich all at once, so I saved the second half for later. The place was pretty packed when I went since Sunday lunch is a pretty busy time, but just got it as takeout and went and sat outside (there's a picnic table right outside the coolidge library which is one of my favorite lunch spots). Glad to have been able to sit in the sun for a bit cause I don't do that as much as I'd like to. All I was missing was a good book (preferrably an autumn romance cause I'm a sucker for fall).",

And thought today I would give it a try.  But sadly don\u2019t think I\u2019m coming back.\n\nI wasn\u2019t sure if I should come in because I have a walker.  But was somehow accommodated. I had a bag and was going to put in underneath near my foot on the floor near the end of the bar.  But was told to go to sit at a single table and place my bags there. As they needed the space at/near the end of the bar.  Ok, but felt it was rather rude how I was instructed. .  When I was about finished eating, the waitress came over and asked if I wanted anything else. When I stated no, the check was provided and then the waitress proceeded to take my plate without asking me if I was done. For which, I quickly replied, I wanted to finish the few pieces of toast on my plate.   Never got a sorry\u2026simply walked away.   But, I will note it was interesting to hear it being asked at the next table if their plate could be taken when she brought them their check.  Why was I an exception?\n\nOh\u2026I will add\u2026, since it was breakfast..I assumed home fries or something besides Chips- sadly home fries is what I thought she meant until she came with a bag of chips.  Oh well I\u2019ll take that as my fault not asking for clarity.\n\nThe mayo on the BLT tasted a bit odd, but I thought it was just me- I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll find out soon.\n\nI only came in because I really wanted a BLT. But I will say, I won\u2019t be coming back. Which is rather sad, as I\u2019m in the area daily and eating someplace in the area daily.",

Both items were delightful and I would order it again. The food was plenty and we had to skip dessert. The restaurant also has outdoor seating. The overall flair of the restaurant isn't great though I highly would recommend to see beyond that and give it a try. I didn't see or ask for a drink menu but I believe they have a BYOB policy. I will ask next time. Across the street, there is a good liquor store.",

                "text": "I came here with family on a Thursday evening -- we were able to get a reservation for 7 people day of. The restaurant has limited seating and was completely filled when we were there. It has a very cozy homey atmosphere, and there were a number of people coming in to get takeout.\n\nI got to try a variety of dishes, and overall I would say that their shrimp is really good -- plump and tender -- and their flavors are generally good. I thought most of the pasta was a bit overcooked for my tastes, but it didn't detract too much from the experience. If I came back, I would definitely get something with shrimp.\n\nMy favorite sauce that I tried was the white wine garlic butter with a touch of tomato sauce (found in the Linguini Scallops, Clams, Shrimps). If I could get that sauce with just shrimp, that would be great. They also have a build your own pasta option, so maybe I'd try a pesto shrimp combo next time.\n\nFor appetizers, I thought the Prosciutto di Parma ($16.00) antipasti was quite good -- good balance of flavors and textures. The fried calamari ($12.00) did not look very glamorous (looked store-bought), but tasted fine. I didn't like the grilled pear salad ($13.50) -- it didn't taste grilled at all, and the flavors didn't work well together for me.\n\nThe risotto frutti di mare ($19.00) had good flavor but the rice texture wasn't that great (a bit mushy). The tiramisu was pretty good, but not my favorite.\n\nOverall I would recommend the prosciutto di parma, anything with shrimp, and anything with white wine garlic butter sauce.",

Crispy skin, with very tender fresh and yet the layers stick together, with smoky mildly sweet and slightly bitter taste that somehow just worked. This eggplant is not a dish you can make on the spot. Probably it was slow cooked and prepared over a long time to get all those elements together.\n\nThe service was excellent, charming older guys taking your order and very knowledgeable about the menu.\n\nThe prices are extremely reasonable, in fact I think they're undercharging.\n\nThe place itself is small and somewhat cramped, which is a double edged sword. On one hand it gives you that rustic mom-and-pop old school Italian restaurant feel, on the other hand... Well it's cramped. And can be difficult to get a table during peak hours.\n\nThere is a pay-parking lot a couple of blocks away for those who drive.",

I ordered ahead on the app and arrived about a half hour before they closed. I understand wanting to start cleaning and winding down before closing, but the employees were rude to us about how we were in just before closing (30 minutes before closing). They didn\u2019t have our food ready because they didn\u2019t have one of the bagels we ordered, which, again, isn\u2019t a big deal in the last hour before they close. However, we told them a replacement bagel and waited 10 minutes before being asked what we were waiting for. We then reminded them of our order and the bagel preference. We had to remind them again what we were waiting for another 10 minutes later to finally get our food. After we left, we discovered they had absolutely gotten our order wrong and my breakfast sandwich was nothing like what I had ordered. All in all, I\u2019m sorry we came at 1:30, but if you stop caring and become mean in the last hour before you close, you shouldn\u2019t be open then.",

                "text": "This is my second time at U Sushi (1393 Beacon St, Brookline, MA 02446) for lunch. Because the first time I felt that their sashimi was not bad (that time I ordered lunch special), I stopped by today and wanted to visit. But this will be my last because the experience was so bad. As soon as I entered the main door, I turned towards the open kitchen and asked, \"Is it still open?\" (It was past two in the afternoon.) A very impatient voice came from behind me: \"Here! Yes!\" A middle-aged woman with short hair. She repeated it twice because I couldn't hear it the first time with headphones on. I ignored how I felt at the moment, I just wanted something to eat. I ordered a Tempura and a Salmon Sashimi. The tempura was fried prawns I didn't feel fresh but I didn't say anything. When I got to the last slice of salmon sashimi, I saw a little bit of black embedded in the fish. It's nothing I usually don't care about, and eat it directly. But I still think it's better to ask, after all, it's sashimi. So I asked the middle-aged woman with short hair what black was. At this time, her attitude was okay, she said that it was just the fish itself and gave me a replacement. I accept this statement. After I finished eating, I settled the bill and was ready to leave. At this point I saw that the total bill of nearly $19 (before tip) felt a bit more expensive than I expected, so I took the menu and asked another male elderly staff, he explained to me that the menu has changed and she just told me. I thought okay, so be it, I was about to leave when the female employee came over and said impatiently, \"You can leave after paying.\" And she invited me out. I feel offended. I have a lot of questions but shouldn't be treated like this. I'm already very polite when I ask questions. Besides, can't customers consult if they have any questions? Do I have to accept the food I paid for that I am not satisfied with? Then I told her that I would never come again, and I would give her one star, and she sneered and said, \"I don't care!\" I thought it was speechless and funny, and I wasn't very angry because it didn't worth it, this middle-aged woman with short hair may be in menopause so she has a bad temper. It's just that I've never had a dining experience like this, I feel so bad, I'd love to get my tip back. I wrote so much to let more people see how this store tramples on the concept of \"customer first\" which is common in the catering industry. I was surprised that the waiter was so arrogant and mean. This is my first time leaving a bad review. This took over 20 minutes. But I hope more people see and try not to come to this restaurant. You have countless better Japanese food options in Boston.",

Couldn\u2019t figure out how to enter as it was 11:50 am and didn\u2019t know if it was closed or not. I walked around the corner to Beacon Street thinking maybe there was another entrance, but there  is not. I backtracked and saw that at 12 noon a sliding window opened which is where you order for take out. I ordered two sandwiches and a salad for $35. The result? Basic sandwich shop with average to below average food and small portions. No way can I find a reason to justify $35 for this, We will not return but always interesting to try a new place.",

The countertops were grimy, and there were visible food scraps and spills left unattended. This blatant disregard for cleanliness is not just unappetizing but poses serious health risks. Dunkin' Donuts needs to address these hygiene issues immediately, or they risk facing serious consequences. Customers deserve better than this, and I will not hesitate to report such neglect if improvements are not made promptly. Additionally, I demand a refund for my unsatisfactory experience. It's imperative that Dunkin' Donuts take swift action to restore trust and ensure that every customer's experience meets basic cleanliness and food safety standards I want a refund!.",

Overall, amazing food and service, and love the different seating/lighting options they have. We used to sit outside during the warmer days, but it's equally as wholesome and family-friendly inside.",

Great customer service, the guy at the counter was very polite and friendly. We got multiple slices of pizza, different kinds and they were big slices. The taste was amazing. We also tried the chilli fries and it was great, forgot to snap a pic because we ended up eating in the car itself. It was loaded with cheese, chili beans and fries, wish it had jalapenos. It's great place to try some delicious food. Very affordable price too. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f",

I don\u2019t blame them, they have to survive but there are so many restaurants I used to go to that just don\u2019t feel worth it these days.\n\nBrookline Pizza Spa is an exception. Their prices are still very fair and their portions are huge without sacrificing quality. I ordered a bunch of sandwiches from here for visiting family and they all were great. This is the first time in a while I can remember thinking \u201cthis was worth it\u201d.\n\nNot only that but the woman I talked to on the phone was so nice and the delivery driver was also very very kind. I don\u2019t get service like that anywhere these days.\n\nPlease go here and support them. They deserve it and you won\u2019t be disappointed.",

All of the items that you guys serve are absolutely delicious. Five stars. I love everyone that works there. They\u2019re always so positive and so kind to talk to. I have a suggestion and it is concerning to me. Today is only 66\u00b0 outside and when I went inside, The Brookline spa, it felt extremely extremely hot very very difficult for your employees to work under those conditions and it\u2019s only 66\u00b0. Imagine when it gets 90\u00b0 and above. My suggestion is you should really supply  The Brookline spa with air conditioning because that is unfair to treat your employees in these types of work conditions. I\u2019m only saying this because I feel like they work really hard and they sacrifice a lot. So the minimum is for them to have comfortable working conditions and that\u2019s not much to ask for. Please think about and consider providing air conditioning for The Brookline spa for the employees. Their performance is gonna go up dramatically I really think , this is something that should be strongly considered",

Maybe it's because I moved here from Cincinnati I'm not as uptight about my food as the Brookline locals, maybe they just had a bad night when these people tried the restaurant out. If you like good, well priced food check them out.",

But the updated menu includes some spruced up toned down American Chinese foods. It\u2019s a perfect mix of traditional and more familiar foods for everyone. This makes sense with the remodel giving it friendly bar, and intimate dining space. Having both less spicy and less intimidating American Chinese food and Sichuan in the same place makes it easier for groups.\n\nIts a great place to being someone who is new to real Chinese food since it has both.\n\nThe bar is very friendly and the staff are wonderful. The high price is justified with the quality of the food, service and atmosphere it provides.",

The bartender took a while to get to us, but it was understandable from how busy it was.\n\nThe one thing that stood out was that when we closed out, the bartender processed our payment and did not look at us or say anything afterwards: no \u201chave a good night\u201d \u201cthank you\u201d or anything like that. We didn\u2019t tip badly nor were we hard to deal with, so I\u2019m not sure why the cold treatment.

                "text": "When my family was coming to town, I had to find a dinner reservation near my apartment in Brookline. I searched the Internet thoroughly and came across a few articles with top restaurants in the Boston area, which this was one of them. We came here on a Saturday night after booking a reservation about a week ahead of time. There are a few tables available outside on the patio beside the sidewalk, but during the summer it can get quite humid and stuffy. We opted for an indoor table near the window, and we were glad we did. The staff were very friendly and quick to get our orders in for drinks and cocktails. After reading online many reviews, it seems as though they are famous for their cocktails. We had two of them, and we\u2019re blown away by their taste. We had the Duan whip and the sour. Both fantastic and tasty. Check out my photos below.\n\nThe food, however, is where this place truly shines. We were a mix of vegetarian and carnivores, and definitely had enough options for all of us. To start, we had the cucumber and chilli oil (very spicy), and the Dan Dan noodles (fantastic flavour). The vegetarians got a lo mein and crispy green beans, which were easily the star of the show and I need to re-create them at home. The green beans were unbelievably tasty and had the best crisp and texture. Would definitely recommend you order those and try them.\n\nWe also got the prosperity noodles with beef and a Kung pao tofu dish, which was my favorite. The tofu was extremely crispy and flavorful, however, there was a few hints of lemongrass which our party did not enjoy. Otherwise, everything had such good flavor. Would 100% recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a good Szechuan style meal in the Boston area.",

Haven't tried much of their menu but had some of their new grilled lamb skewer special... And wow. $2 or $2.50 for a skewer is a great price for a delicious bite to eat. I would get three or four of these and maybe a soup for less than $10 and just be extremely happy at midnight on a weekend.\n\nCan't wait to keep visiting this place.",

The General Tsao's Chicken had the perfect balance of sweet and spicy, with crispy chicken pieces coated in a flavorful sauce. The Chicken Teriyaki was equally impressive, with tender, juicy chicken and a rich, savory teriyaki glaze. Both dishes were cooked to perfection and served with generous portions.

When I got there I told them I was picking up an order and they told me they were making it right now. 3 people came in after that and also ordered bowls. 2 or them got their orders before I, so I asked about my order and they again said it was being made right now, so I said okay. A few minutes later they gave me an order that did not match what I had ordered, so I asked if it was correct and they then realized that they gave me the wrong one and that my order had been sitting in the fridge, probable for at least 15 minutes as I was waiting there for 20. I got back to my place and went to eat it and realized that they didn't give me the Bananas that were supposed to be on it and there was about 3 small pieces of cut strawberry on it. I am GREATLY disappointed with what I received and will not return or recomend to anyone.\n\nUpdate - there were 3 slices of banana that sunk to the bottom. Still disappointing and still would not return.",

I have mixed feelings about this place....I have only had one product here, so I cannot remark on the menu as a whole, though I saw a bowl today that looked like a piece of art.  Within the last 2/3weeks, I have ordered their hot Peanut Butter coffee.  If you enjoy these two things, you will possibly be in for a treat.  I ordered this every day for a week....half of the week was delicious; the other half, it tasted as if they had only used 1/3 the amount of pb, so that it was a hint instead of the feature of the beverage.  I enjoy coffee, so I just let it go but it would be nice to have a consistent experience.  The other observation is the customer service...No one was outwardly rude; however, today was the 1st time I walked in and did not feel I was bothering the staff. There also seems to be no way to alert the staff you have entered.   Today, the woman was smiling, was warm and made my coffee in a third of the time it has ever taken.  This is odd because there was an actual line today and she was quicker than when I am the only one there!   I always order Hot instead of iced and once, when I came to pick up, it was Iced.  The employee remarked \"most people order Iced because it's hot outside\"--I wasn't offended, it just came across as if my choice was illogical as opposed to her mistake due to the weather-related assumption.  The woman today added a tad too much milk that tempered the heat of my coffee, but she was so pleasant and the coffee, at least, tasted the way it should, so I did not even care.  I point it out to illustrate when you have a welcoming demeanor, it can really change an experience even if it was not perfect.",

                "text": "After a long day I was craving a cheeseburger. Conveniently located almost at the crux of Coolidge Corner, this seemed like a good option.  Non of the specialty burgers seemed attractive to me, so I ordered a regular cheeseburger with lettuce and tomato and some fries. With a fried egg on top.\n\nLet me get the good out of the way: the burger patty was juicy, it was delicious, it was thick and worth the price. The fries also were excellent. I got them with barbecue sauce (which I would not recommend), but by their lonesome they were perfectly fried and seasoned which is impressive considering how thick they were. Really nice job with both the patty and the fries.\n\nI was way less impressed with the toppings. The lettuce was iceberg quality and helpfully fell out in a single piece as I was trying to eat it. The buns were low quality and became essentially mush as I attempted to eat the top tall hamburger (and this was with me removing two toppings). The fried egg was overcooked and extraneous. When I order a fried egg on a burger I expect it to be cooked well, not well done.\n\nThat all being said, this is a burger joint and the burger was by far the best part of the meal. Moreover the fries were really good. I think if you\u2019re craving a decent burger in the area you could do worse. But there are definitely better options if you want to venture into Boston.",

It has always been exactly what it says: spicy and crispy... until now.\nThe past two times, the chicken has been more like the frozen chicken cutlet you get at the supermarket. Absolutely not crispy, flat, and flacid (kind of like the place with the arches). Flavor of spice is still there, just the texture and crunch was a huge miss. We thought it may have been a mistake the last time so we decided to get it again. We were once again disappointed.\nWe always found the spicy crispy chicken better than that famous place from a southern state, but now it is much further at the bottom in terms of crispy chicken sandwiches.",

I get that feeling that many of them were new, so things will probably be more natural with time.\n\nHowever, the food was disappointing. The papaya salad was too sweet, without the savory flavors of garlic, shrimp, or even chilis. Texture was nice though. The lemongrass chicken was roasted, but felt super crispy. The accompaniments of macaroni salad, rice (a bit mushy) and fruit were underwhelming. We tried the macarons too\u2014nice texture on the outside but super thick cream on the inside. Overall, sad to say but we won\u2019t be back.",

Staff are super friendly. We highly recommend the bao, bone marrow bahn mi, beef wellington, and even the fries were excellent! For the (sweet) coffee lover, the egg coffee is a must try. Can't wait to try out the other menus!\n\nLunch menu has amazing butter egg on fluffy milk bread sandwiches!",

They have a focus on Western dishes with an Asian twist.\n\nThe restaurant's first floor boasts a large seating area with a large bar. We came during brunch time, and it was crowded but still had a lot of space for seating upstairs. We were seated almost instantly. The service was exceptional, with them explaining the dishes, checking in on our food throughout the meal, and bringing the food out in a timely manner.\n\nThe prices of the dishes are on the average size for the portion, but we really enjoyed the food we got here. We got the Jasmine Tea and the Vietnamese Egg Coffee, both of which were really good and had traditional flavors in them. For our brunch, we got the Souffle Pancakes and the Karaage Chicken with Egg on Milk Bread. The Milk bread sandwich was fluffy and the karaage wasn't too oily, and it came in a decent portion size. The Souffle pancake came with a light syrup that wasn't too sweet. The souffle did look a little deflated, but was still pretty good and fluffy. We also got the truffle fries, which came with a decent portion of truffle, as well as a nice dipping sauce for the fries.\n\nOverall a good place to go to for a brunch out. The dinner menu also looks pretty good and enticing, such as the banh mi & bone marrow charcuterie plate.",

I usually have no issues with my cheesy Gordita crunches however today all 3 of the one in my order were extremely stale and the soft taco was completely off of the crunchy shell, defeating the point of the taco. Further my chicken taco was split all down the bottom before I even unwrapped it. Besides that it all tasted well, and service was good. Hole to have better quality next time.",

If you are craving for a good fast food meal and don\u2019t want to spend a fortune this place is for you. The food somehow tastes better than at other Taco Bell\u2019s, I hope they\u2019ll keep up with the qually. I had a five layer cheesy burrito, and of course a Crunchwrap supreme and boy oh boy it brought back these old memories. Don\u2019t forget to ask for an enormous amount of hot sauce packets which really add to any dish. The place is brand new and clean. I didn\u2019t interact too much with the staff as they have six touch screens where you can put in your order, but the staff was really really nice.\nI am a local guide but earth is my hometown, meaning that ive had tacos in many many many very many different restos, and Taco Bell is still always special. A very brave bet to open a Taco Bell in this location but virtue saves the brave.",

Their red and yellow curries are great, very comforting and tasty each and every time that we've had them. Their tofu pad Thai is very good. The chicken katsu that you can order with pad Thai is hit or miss though. We've had some that were over fried and very dry.\n\nTheir portion sizes are good but can be a bit inconsistent sometimes. The sticky rice with mango dessert and coconut sauce is great though a tag too sweet for me so I skip the sauce. The spring rolls and calamari rings are decent appetizers but portions are on the small side. The ramen and sushi dishes are not the standouts at this restaurant but acceptable for a quick meal. I always get a Thai ice tea here, very refreshing and not too sweet.\n\nService is friendly and quick. I see families with small children here quite often. This restaurant offers consistently good food at reasonable prices. It is a great addition to the neighborhood.",

                "text": "TLTR: Solid 4/5.\n\nTried this place after a friend recommended them for their gluten-free noodle option.\n\nNot bad. Had their tofu and tuna rolls \u2014 unexpectedly good, y\u2019all. (Though I did not appreciate their approach to a hand roll. It was like a seaweed taco. Couldn\u2019t take a clean bite.) The way they got so much flavor into a stick of tofu is admirable. Their spicy tuna was delicious, reminiscent of tuna tartare.\n\nTried their spicy miso ramen, made with a chicken broth instead of tonkotsu, which I appreciate. Instead of chashu, had the chicken \u2014 nice flavor with a hint of ginger. My friend had the chashu, which he said would have been nicer with some charring/ could have used more time in the broiler. Their noodles are *on point.* Cooked just right. It\u2019s either MSG or a novel deliciousness carrier technology \u2014 the way those noodles carry flavor is something else. The broth needs further elaboration. A bit too heavy on the salt and superficial on the flavoring. But the foundations are there to make it superb with just a little tweaking. Perfect ajitama.\n\nTheir sticky rice is on the sweeter side, with a hint of coconut. Delicious. To me, more enjoyable as dessert. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nMy friend tried their Thai iced tea. I had their strawberry matcha. Maybe they taste better spiked, but we got them just as tea and they were unremarkable. My strawberry matcha was not milky enough and too sweet. They did seem to use a strawberry pur\u00e9e, which was nice. The boba though \u2014 some of the best boba I\u2019ve had, which kept nicely over the couple hours it took me to finish the drink. \ud83d\ude05 (That\u2019s how stuffed I was.)\n\nThe place itself is simple, though with a trendy vibe and eclectic music playlist. Varied menu. Appreciate the ceiling feature of hanging 2x4s. Bathrooms were quite clean.\n\nAll in all, do recommend you try it out. I\u2019ll def be back to try their pho and other dishes.",

                "text": "Mecha Noodle Bar is a ramen & pho shop located in the heart of Coolidge Corner, with another location in the Seaport District of Boston. It has a very modern interior with an open kitchen, as well as many seating options throughout the restaurant. When we came, it was very crowded, but were seated almost instantly. However, I would probably not come here with a party larger than 4 due to the limited large-group seating and how popular the restaurant is.\n\nThe service was phenomenal. They were quick to serve us, as well as had enough waitstaff on hand to keep circulating to take finished dishes away and refill water nearly instantly after it was empty. Even with how busy the restaurant is, it was nice to see they could continue to care for the customers.\n\nWe tried the Soft-Shelled Crab Bao and the Shoyu Ramen. The Soft-Shelled Crab Bao came with Pickles and a nice sauce drizzle on it. The soft shelled crab was fried lightly, and it wasn't oily at all. The Shoyu Ramen was pretty good. One minor gripe was with the noodles, it felt a bit too stringy and not like typical ramen noodles, instead more similar to buckwheat or soba noodles , but it was still pretty good and had good flavor. The broth wasn't too salty and was overall a good dish.\n\nA good first experience at this restaurant and would highly recommend checking it out.",

Me and my husband are vegetarians and to our surprise they have a variety of veg dishes. We also aren't a huge fan of mushrooms but we really loved the mushroom dishes here.\n\nWe tried a variety of dishes like shitake mushroom baos which were delicious, herbed edmame which was okayish. I loved the tofu banh mi, it was freshly made, crisp and perfectly seasoned. The cold tofu rolls were also not that bad. The kimchi fried rice was tasty too but we felt it had a bit more oil. They could have avoided putting so much oil. That's the only reason giving them 4 stars for food.\n\nDrinks were also nice, we tried the Iron Fist and Eastern bonfire ritual and liked the later one more.\n\nWe will definitely visited again, would love to try their veg Ramen and would also love to have a few dishes again!\ud83d\ude01",

I like their iced green tea as well, brewed just right and served with perfect amount of ice. Order large as medium would definitely leave you wanting for more.. Kids menu is also very well priced with fair portion.",

                "text": "Maruichi Select is a cafe with a small market area that is good for studying. This is located across the street from the Maruichi grocery store, which carries more robust options for groceries.  There are some similarities in products they carry such as Onigiri, but Maruichi Select has a wider focus on meals such as Curry, Ramen, and Katsudon.\n\nThe area is very open, with a sizeable amount of seating located in the back, however it does get quite busy and may be difficult to find seating when coming here in the afternoon. The service is quite quick, even with a long line the food still came out within 10-15 minutes.\n\nWe tried the Matcha Strawberry Latte, the White Peach Shaved Ice, the Chashu + Egg, Karaage, and Spicy Karaage Onigiri. The Matcha Strawberry Latte was smooth and mixed quite well, and tasted not too sweet. The strawberry at the bottom helped add a bit of sweetness that wasnt too overwhelming. I don't like white peach at all, but the shaved ice was light and fluffy and did have a good peachy flavor. The highlight probably was the Onigiri. Compared to the Onigiri sold at the grocery stores, these ones were much larger, with a decent filling to rice ratio (though a bit more heavy on the rice side) for the price. The spicy karaage was my favorite, as it had a good amount of spices placed on it that weren't too overwhelming but gave it a bit of a kick.\n\nOverall a great experience and I would highly recommend checking it out. They also do have pop-ups and other vendors tabling around the store.",

The presentations were engaging, and I followed my daughter's lead on how to handle different dishes before tasting. Again, it was a fun and interactive dining experience - we weren't just eating a steak.",

Interior has been redone from the Six Po hot pot that was here previously and it looks and feels great, very clean and comfortable.\n\nThe pan fried egg/chive bun has very good flavors but the skin had an undercooked texture. The steamed pork dumplings tasted good with a good deal of soup inside. The taro buns were our favorite. They were well made, not greasy, crispy on the outside and not too sweet. The spicy beef noodle soup was only mildly spicy and broth was thin. It lacked flavor and the noodles, I felt, were undercooked in the thick part and overcooked in the thinner part, making the texture strange when chewing. I wouldn't get this again but will try the dry noodles that have a sauce on it, which might have more flavor. We were disappointed by the scallion pancake with beef. The pancake was a bit greasy, which was expected, but there was only 1 small thin slice of beef wrapped inside.\n\nService was fine. Our waiter was efficient and the server that brought the food was friendly and always had a smile. He asked how we liked the food each time. This new place is a good addition to the neighborhood.",

We ended up using one pot between 5 people, which I think is close to the reasonable limit that can comfortably use one pot. We got the two flavor broth with bone broth and the spicy premium beef tallow broth. I don't remember if we got mild or medium, but it was very spicy. I didn't end up using any of my sauce because the spicy broth was so strongly flavored.\n\nThe highlight for me was definitely the shrimp paste, but I haven't really met a shrimp paste that I don't like. The fish fillet was also pretty good, as was the sliced premium beef (the fatty one). I wouldn't get the ribeye or marinated spicy beef again -- those didn't have good texture.\n\nThere were a couple of things for which we weren't sure of the freshness -- the bamboo fungus, for example, had some black spots and didn't taste great. I hope it wasn't mold...\n\nThe sauce bar had a good selection, but it did cost $2.95 per person. And if you get the spicy broth, I don't think the sauce is needed. I don't know what it was, but the food was *really* hot which made it a bit hard to eat for impatient people like me.\n\nOverall I liked the shrimp paste, but nothing else was particularly notable. I prefer the broth and meats at Happy Lamb AYCE, so I would definitely go there over here.",

We had multiple staff members not assigned to our table coming up and asking us about drinks and ordering food, we had someone come with our appetizer that we had already received, servers pacing around the restaurant, and long waits in between receiving the bill and actually paying. At times it felt like they were very attentive but at other times it was like I was invisible. Restaurant wasn't really busy, outdoor seating was empty and indoor seating wasn't too full either, I'm hoping I just came on a bad day. Service wasn't horrible, just a bit concerning and food was good enough that it made up for the shaky hospitality. Would give it a second chance, can't stop thinking about the quick-fried brussels sprouts!",

Someone really put much thought into it. Pretty table settings and plates, bowls, even the chopstick rests! Nice lighting, nice bathroom..and even the fish they bring your bill in is pretty.\nMenu: not your typical Korean bibimbap and other array of typical dishes. Small dishes (\u201cKorean tapas\u201d) include some items that you probably don\u2019t see often in other Korean restaurants (such as grilled chicken gizzards, spicy pork feet, Yun ha Yuk, spicy crab meat, etc.) and a few sharable dishes including simmered beef rib. The portions are small, but the price point is not too high. I\u2019d definitely order a few and share with friends.\n\nFood: I really liked the side dishes. Yes, they do charge $1.5 for additional side dishes, but these are much better than the typical ones you get at other Korean places. (I recently went to another Korean place not too far from here, and I didn\u2019t even touch some of the dishes/ it was expensive and not satisfying.) Spicy potato salad was my favorite and the stewed pork was also good. And their kimchi was served in a manner that I\u2019ve not seen in Korean restaurants in the states for a while- cut fresh, in an elegant manner! It was on a very ripe side, but it was delicious.\nThe \u201cdduk galbi\u201d was a little sweet and lot a lot of meat.($25). But it was done in a careful way and the presentation was nice. The meat quality was also nice. Him so ($5) was good. They also give you a slice of it as an appetizer. They also give you a sweet cinnamon welcome drink.\n\nService: very attentive and friendly.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my food and my time there. It\u2019s more thoughtful, elegant, and refined than a lot of other Korean places. The only thing is that the rice isn\u2019t included in the dishes.($3 extra).\n\nI\u2019d definitely visit again.",

It was a nostalgic treat that immediately reminded me of \ud560\uba38\ub2c8 \uc190\ub9db (grandma\u2019s cooking) back in Korea.

The staff offered us the Hojicha chiffon cake on the house for desserst, which we were very thankful for. Overall, it is a place that we will return frequently and enjoy every meal with friend and family.",

Definitely the Zing Fried Chicken, which deserves 5 stars. It's my favorite dish at this restaurant. We ordered all the ramen they offer: Yaki Shoyu Ramen, Roasted Sesame Miso Ramen, and Spicy Miso Ramen. Here's how I rate them: Yaki Shoyu Ramen > Spicy Miso Ramen > Roasted Sesame Miso Ramen. I think the Yaki Shoyu is the best of the three options. Personally, I\u2019m not a fan of really thick and soft ramen noodles, so this place may not become my new favorite. All three soups were also a bit too salty for me, and I couldn't finish the broth.\n\nOn the service side, everything was great\u2014super pleasant, attentive, and customer-focused. If I go back, I\u2019ll definitely order the Zing Fried Chicken again. As for the ramen, I\u2019ll have to think it over, but I\u2019d probably stick with the Yaki Shoyu Ramen.",

Went on a pretty rainy day and the line was way out the door, so clearly speaks to how amazing the place is! Our food was a little delayed apparently (we only waited 15 minutes for it), but they gave us a free fried chicken for that, which was so nice! They also handed out little ramen stickers and pins, which was adorable and a nice touch :)",

Tangsu sauce was good.\nJjajang myeon $14 Jjajang sauce flavor was good but again drier than typical jjajang sauce and left noodles not moist even after sauce was mixed in.\nTteok bokki $14 Thoroughly enjoyed! Full flavor and just right amount of spicy kick.\nSeating was like the wood church pew chairs, hard as rock , so uncomfortable.\nVibe seemed perfect for solo diners to come and enjoy comfort foods.",

                "text": "Compared to other many other Korean restaurants (in the US and Korea) the beef bulgogi was ok/pretty average; not too special but pretty tender. The portion was also very large. However the chicken bibimbap was bland and flavorless. The chicken was boiled, dry snd unseasoned, just like the rice. There was no sesame oil on the egg, rice, or vegetables, which is a staple in bibimbap.\n\nTtukbaegi bulgogi soup was flavorful and had a good assortment of vegetables, noodles and rice cakes (over cooked, but may be due to takeout). The mul nangmyeon was very watery. Even if the ice in the soup melted because we got takeout, it was watery to a point where there was almost no flavor (regardless, the ice should have been made out of soup rather than water). The only source of flavor came from the vegetable toppings  (cucumber and radish).\n\nThe banchan (side dishes) were very small and included pickled radish, kimchi, and boiled broccoli. The rice was very stale and resembled cheap takeout rice rather than the type of rice typically served in Korean restaurants.\n\nOverall, the soup and beef were pretty good, the nangmyeon was bland (may be due to takeout) and the bibimbap was bland. 2.5/5",

I highlight this point because it has been quite a frequent problem with many hotels.\n\nWould stay here again on the next trip to Boston. Location was great too. Very short walking distance from the Back Bay station and the Prudential shopping mall.",

My wife has speech challenges with PPA. We came through the hotel with a tour group, and the first night and last night were here at this beautiful hotel.\n\nThe first night was a welcome party, and the wait staff was very rude towards my wife because of her speech problems. I had a conversation with the staff member, and that was a waste because the gentleman refused to apologize even when the whole table witnessed.\n\nOn our way back through, we checked in, and it was the same rudeness with the front desk.\n\nI would never recommend this place. Rudeness from service people is unacceptable for any price, and at 400 a night, you expect a level of service that this place just doesn't offer.\n\nNever again.\n\nEdit Sept 7 2024 - no one ever contacted me.",

I have been staying here for 3 nights, and unfortunately, I have encountered an issue that has made my stayvery uncomfortable. The room I am currently staying in has a strong smell of cigarettes, which I find unacceptable, especially in a non-smoking hotel environment. I addressed this issue with the receptionist, kindly explaining that I have been staying for three nights and that I cannot tolerate the condition any longer.\n\nAdditionally, I have reserved three other rooms for my company members, and I would expect that, as a loyal customer, my concerns would be taken seriously. However, the receptionist has not provided a satisfactory resolution. Instead, I was informed that I would have to keep my luggage outside of the room for approximately five hours until a different room becomes available and she was objecting and making derogatory personal opinions about me. This lack of urgency and consideration has left me deeply unsatisfied.\n\nI would like to express my extreme disappointment with both the condition of the room and the poor service I have received from the front desk staff, particularly the receptionist in question. This experience does not meet the standard I expected from your hotel, and I believe it needs immediate attention.\n\nI kindly request that you address this issue promptly and provide a suitable resolution for my discomfort or I will be forced to leave. I also expect a formal response regarding the service and I hope the owner of this hotel will take customer service seriously going forwards.",

The French Onion Soup was mediocre at best and required a hard stir to get flavor off the bottom.  The calamari were cooked nicely but had very little seasoning and the marinara was bland.  Those of us that had steaks all agreed, they were very salty and all three came out at the same temp even though we ask for one to be medium rare plus.  I guess the plus was hard to achieve.  We ended with a very nice coconut cake and espresso martinis.  The cakeI would definitely recommend.",

We paired it with a lobster tail that tasted just like you expect a lobster tail to taste. But frankly could have been presented better. The creamed spinach was absolutely fantastic!

I had been to Grill 23 once over fifteen years ago and remembered their dry aged New York strip to be the best steak I'd ever had, and it still has not been topped for me. Portions were much larger than other fine dining establishments and we left feeling like we'd just had a Thanksgiving meal! The creme brulee topped off a magical dining experience, with a thin dish to maximize the caramelized topping and a lovely addition of fresh fruits and a wafer cookie. Not the kind of place we could afford on the regular, but for times when you've got to pull out all the stops it's the best in the city.",

It is such a beautiful experience you can\u2019t find anywhere else. The food has been phenomenal for us every time and the entertainment is just unreal. The service is minimal but in an appreciate way. They check in regularly and notice when you need new drinks but don\u2019t hover and a manager has always checked in to see how our experience is going. The service makes sense for the atmosphere. It feels like the food and entertainment are the focal point and the service is there to support those things without getting in the way.

The food is alright but not particularly memorable. However, the service is not great. The waiters seem to be a bit aloof and are not knowledgeable about the menu, and the prices are a bit too high for the mediocre quality of the food. They seem to have very few grain-free options. We came here today for brunch and had a pleasant meal listening to an amazing jazz set. We ordered a frittata, some cocktails, and a slice of cheesecake. They did not have any to-go cups for my son to take apple juice with him. It can also be quite difficult to find parking anywhere nearby.",

They've got a live band playing, which sets a fantastic, relaxed vibe, and the staff are super chill, adding to the laid-back weekend feel. The food is decent; I usually go for the eggs Benedict, but I decided to switch it up this time, and I wasn't disappointed.\n\nAlso, don't skip the coffee cake\u2014it might sound a bit odd to have dessert as an appetizer, but trust me, it really works here. And of course, you can't go wrong with ordering a Bloody Mary to round off the perfect brunch experience. Great atmosphere, good food, and lively music make for an enjoyable weekend outing.",

Last night I pity tipped 20% because the waiter and manager were kind and respectful about my concerns about the evening but I honestly wanted to tip 10% (I did not).\n\nOverall experience was a 6/10",

Service wasnt insanely fast but  we were seated outside with only 1 other table and it was a bit after lunch so we were unbothered.\n\nFood was great, apps were pricey but the meals were great portions and not obnoxiously expensive.\n\nWill definitely swing by the one in Terminal E the next time I fly internationally! I have never used my Chase Sapphire Credit their yet and now im alittle bummed",

Despite all of that and more, the hostess Marianna was very understanding and found us a small booth \ud83d\ude4f her kindness began our 1st experience at the Atlantic Fish Company.\n\nAndr\u00e9 was our server. His attentive service and energetic candor made for a spectacular evening! I especially appreciated his detailed knowledge of the food ingredients and impeccable timing on checking up on our table. Our water glasses and prosecco were never empty or waiting.\n\nWe ordered 2 appetizers; the tuna tartare and crispy calamari Milano. The tartare was my favorite, very subtle, and soft flavor of horseradish and wasabi. My partner enjoyed the extremely light batter of the calamari; the hot peppers add a nice zing!\n\nFor entrees, we had the Halibut with spinach & mushrooms, and the Chilean Sea bass. The sea bass had the fish taste I was craving for! The Halibut was cooked to perfection and is a hefty portion, I couldn't finish it. Speaking of which, the 2 sides are VERY generous portions as well. My taste buds say YES, but my stomach capacity pleaded Nooo.\n\nHowever, there is always room for dessert; we had cappucinos with the Special of the Day Bread Pudding, and a creme brulee. The bread pudding comes with vanilla ice cream, tasted like an autumn pie \u263a\ufe0f and I loved how fresh the fat blueberries were on top of the smooth creme brulee!\n\nThe only disappointment was the limoncello; theirs was a creamy type instead of it being light and bright.\n\nSide note: The inner front door is in dire need of lubrication... that shrieking squeaking dissonance absolutely ruins the atmosphere. It seemed frivolous at first, but upon talking to the Manager (turquoise tie), he apologized and acknowledged the issue. I appreciated his temporary solution of keeping the door open. With the popularity and value of this establishment, I would hope that the Owner resolves that with the proper tools ASAP. I was tempted to pick up a silicone WD40 and apply it for them good grief.",

I was tired of walking so we decided to stop for a drink.\n\nThe restaurant is beautiful! The hostess was very helpful and we took a seat at the bar. Our drinks were delicious so we decided to order some food.\n\nWe shared an appetizer and entree which they divided up for us. Our total was $109 so this place is not for those on a tight budget. Technically, we paid for one meal and 2 drinks so you can easily spend hundreds here. The food was exceptional!\n\nThe bathroom was clean. This is always important to me. Plenty of space in the stalls and a foot handle on the door.\n\nThe bartenders and wait staff were very accommodating. I am happy to have found this place and would certainly recommend it for a date night or hanging out with friends.",

The service was a bit slow, which was concerning because we had tickets for the theater and it became a little bit stressful. It was a little surprising that they couldn\u2019t get our food out more quickly because it was an early dinner and there were very few tables occupied.\n\nHaving said that, everybody seemed to enjoy their food. This is a small chain that I understand was recently acquired by a private equity firm. Usually private equity investors are focused on cutting expenses, and that could explain why there was not enough staff to effectively operate the restaurant.  Our server was quite pleasant and she was trying hard. We ate indoors because it was a little bit warm outside and we had a comfortable booth toward the back, which was quiet and good for our conversation. I think in Boston, you probably have a lot of superior options for seafood, but this was close to our theater and it fit the bill.",

I'm from down south and any Waffle House would have better service than this place.\n\nService was extremely slow, and our whole table ordered clam chowders which only came out after we got our entrees, which took nearly an hour. Our waiter seemed to have just forgotten about us considering we had to ask about where our food and drinks were before they brought them out? The waiter also gave our entrees out to the wrong people, and deflected blame for it onto us after we started giving our entries to who actually ordered them instead of just not saying anything\nAnother amazing facet of service was I finished my water cup at the beginning of the meal after we ordered, and the only time my water was refilled was at the end of the meal after we were already done eating. Only 2/6 of people even got that water refill at the end too, and the waiter was basically sloshing the water out of my cup too?\n\nThe food we ordered was alright, but I doubt it is worth it compared to literally anywhere else that sells the same stuff with the level of service that we received.",

First, they had a special promotion on a steamed lobster dinner (oh yeah!). Plus, the service and suggestions from our server Martin made this visit exceptional. Get the Boston Cream Pie for dessert!! Thank you Martin, and great job Legal Sea Foods!",

He was warm and courteous to all our additional request.I even spilled water by mistake and he didn\u2019t make me feel embarrassed and was smiling throughout and was empathetic. Talking about food I ordered the lobster roll, which lacked flavor and was mediocre and pricey however the service provided compensated it.",

The appetizers we ordered were not good at all (tuna nachos in particular were horrible), and the drinks weren\u2019t good either. The reason we came in the first place was for the lobster mac and cheese, but the server completely forgot about it. We didn\u2019t care to remind her because the appetizers were extremely sub par and not worth the price at all. I would highly recommend finding another place to dine. This chain has gone downhill over the years, and are there are numerous other great seafood restaurants in the area that will be much more worth your time and money.",

Reasonably prices, fresh/quality ingredients, great proportions for the cost. Great summer salad, not a huge fan of the cheese but that's just personal preference. Also tried the vanilla ice cream, highly recommend the ice cream. Would visit again for sure.",

This place serves some of the best pizza on this side of Boston, and the service was impressively quick. Our server was attentive and on top of everything. From our table, we could see the pizza oven and watch the chefs make everything from scratch, which added to the wonderful atmosphere. The combination of great food, efficient service, and a vibrant setting makes Picco a must-visit. I'll definitely be coming back again.",

Since it was close to work, I went for a quick bite.\nIt was just after 6 on a Saturday, so busy, yet not crowded. I was able to grab a seat at the bar without delay.\nI chose the burrata and meatball appetizers. HAVE MERCY!!!! The strawberry rhubarb jam was such a burst of brightness in my mouth. The crunch of pistachios made a great change in texture. The biscuits are adorable, open faced, grilled biscuits (that are incredible). The meatballs are what you would expect at a fave pizza spot. Plenty of flavor, just enough sauce... mmmm.\nI placed a to go order for pizza. Half pepperoni and half sausage/fennel/ ricotta. Heated a slice of each the next day for lunch. Now I see why Picco is on the best pizza list in Boston. Even reheated leftover is delicious.\nIt's located in a prime area on Tremont St, so don't expect street parking. There is a public parking garage you drive into from the back of building, but walk out on the front (conveniently at the door for Picco).\nThey have a nice ice cream selection that I passed on. However, I saw plenty of people ordering dessert.",

Atmosphere was lively, our server was fun to banter with and the food was fantastic.

The cakes are scrumptious and full of flavours - love the Fall range.\nOur server Jairo deserves to be the Employee of the Month - he was absolutely attentive, proactive and very approachable.\n\nOnly feedback - we waited 30 minutes for a table. This despite at least 15 tables we saw visibly available.  We went to the bathrooms and could see so many available spots. The front desk hosts were so laid-back with no sense of urgency or care to have people seated.  This would deter us but after all it's the Cheesecake Factory!",

Once we were seated, we waited 15 minutes to get our drink order & another 5 for menus.   Two attractive ladies arrived were seated, and you can imagine how irritated I was that Randy went to their table first to take their order. He was engaged in some very long personal conversation as I saw him looking at pictures on one lady's cellphone.   There is nothing worse than good food with bad service.",

He was the highest of professionals.  So calm just making sure the meal was perfect.\n\nOrdered the bacon wrapped squash as an appetizer and it was phenomenal.  The mustard sauce was the perfect wrapper.  I'd order it again.\n\nFor the main I went with Veal Diane au gratin potatoes and brussel sprouts.  Absolutely perfectly prepared and seasoned.   A spectacular success.\n\nNo room for dessert but I'm sure it would have been a bow on the experience.\n\nIf I had to have any complaints I'd say that the som being busy could be it but it wasn't a game changer.  Also was a bit loud for business conversation but it's a Friday night I really shouldn't complain.\n\nValet was a bit disorganized but also not that big of a deal.",

The restaurant offers a nice blend of Northern Italian cuisine with American steakhouse staples, though nothing really stood out on the menu.\n\nWhat made the visit special was how accommodating they were with kids. The staff was friendly and attentive, making it a relaxed dining experience for the whole family. The atmosphere was upscale yet welcoming, and they provided options that were kid-friendly, which is always appreciated.\n\nOverall, it's a great place for a family dinner in a nice setting, especially if you're dining with little ones.",

We used the arcade, bowled, played pool, ate, and had a blast. We weren\u2019t sure how purchasing a card for the arcade worked, so we asked. The manager himself came over, coached us through it, and even gave us free credits to get us started(which wasn\u2019t necessary or expected at all). The customer service was amazing\u2026from the manager, to our server, to the staff working the counter. It was a pleasure to give them our business and we will definitely be back.

Walking in, I immediately felt transported back to my arcade days. The dark walls with the occasional neon lights were super-nostalgic.  The GM, Cyle, was super friendly, and personally showed my partner and me to the lounge where we grabbed some high-quality-yet-totally-affordable American food (i.e. burgers, fries, chocolate cake).  As vegetarians, my partner and I were so glad they had Impossible Burgers - which were cooked to perfection! After eating, we headed over to King's super-sleek bowling allies to burn off some calories (and drink their delicious mojitos \ud83d\ude09).  All-in-all, spending a couple hours at King's was super fun & super relaxing on a hot summer night. And totally affordable!  My partner and I left King's with huge smiles on our faces - and every intention of coming back.\nAlso, a special shout out to our super-polite servers: Brendan & Ashley. You guys were very awesome, thanks! \ud83d\ude4f",

                "text": "I was there recently for a quick bite on the annual Boston Marathon day.  Looking for a casual but good seafood place, I stumbled upon this restaurant, and was very pleasantly surprised.\n\nI expected a run of the mill menu, with some seafood dishes scattered among the regular bar food cuisine.  However, not only did I find a very decent selection of seafood, the quality surpassed my expectations.  Starting with the mouth watering Crab Cake appetizer, the absolutely delicious and flavorful Bouillabaisse (with a very hearty sauce and a generous amount of shrimp and mussels) for the main course, and finally to the biggest surprise, one of the best Pecan Pies for dessert, I could not have been more satisfied.  Sitting at the bar and having this great food was an additional treat, as the staff is very friendly and relaxed, and the ambiance very inviting and warm.\n\nIt was a great decision on my part to walk into this place on a whim, but it will definitely be a place I will return to.  If you happen to be in the area and want a lively, good seafood experience, with very reasonable prices, this is a great choice.",

We didn't have a reservation, were seated right away but we definitely recommended it.\n\nAs soon as I opened the door, the aroma from all the spices were incredible. The food was incredible, service was very prompt. The lamb coconut curry dish was amazing, it was nice and hot, the garlic and onion naan and the mango lassi were good. We were seated in front of the window and it was just a beautiful feeling. I would say it's a tight place but there is plenty of space, a very cozy restaurant, the chairs were a bit uncomfortable but suitable. The atmosphere was very peaceful, relaxing, everyone enjoying the moment.  I can't wait to come back.\n\nCame back once again, did not disappoint me. I loved the service, the food was amazing.",

One of the TVs had a horrible gren hue to it, one was running about 10 minutes behind of the others. Nothing tasted fresh, the fries were either frozen or had been sitting out for a while and were cold, but the seasoning was really good. Fish also had the texture of pre frozen fish but had a nice light batter. The nachos were very soggy by the time they got to the table and were not hot. Biggest issue was that in the women's room the locks DO NOT WORK. They unlock if someone turns the handle from the outside. Had to ask for water multiple times and at some point our server stopped showing up so we had to track them down. The hostess was leaning on the podium smacking gum with her mouth open.",

We didn't know that in MA you can't order a double (and our waitress clearly knew we weren't from there based on our IDs) and we ordered a double vodka redbull. Were scammed out of $30 for one drink. I know drinking in boston is super expensive, but that was insane! I was later told by a different bartender elsewhere that the only way they can \"legally\" serve a double is being charged 2 shots separately, and then were charged $8 for half a can of redbull. Absolutley insane. To add, our food was so-so, we had to go up to the bar to ask for silverware and napkins because we werent given any. basement is kind of cool. I feel like it would have been nice for her to warn us.  We probably would have ended up spending more money here because it could have been fun if this didn't happen.\n\nMaybe we weren't taken advantage of and it was assumed we would know how much that would cost but a heads up would have been nice.",

My alma mater hosted an event here before.\n\nOverall Service: 3.34/5\nFoods: 2.5/5, Service: 4/5, Ambiance: 3.5/5, Cleanliness: 3.5/5\n\nWith multiple bars, including a separate dance floor on the lower level, it can accommodate a sizeable crowd of up to 393 people (according to the staff). The place tends to get packed post-9pm on weekends, but it maintains a more relaxed vibe during weekdays. The friendly staff, especially the bartenders, add to the welcoming atmosphere. A tip: if you're yearning for a seat, scout the areas with large TVs; most patrons prefer to queue up for the dance floor.\n\nWhen it comes to foods, unfortunately, Clerys didn't quite hit the mark here. The chicken wings, despite their reputation on the menu, were a disappointment. Overcooked and dry, they left my taste buds longing for more. The garlic parmesan sauce, too, fell short, barely coating the wings and leaving the flavor flat. Maybe it was my bad luck. A silver lining was found in the Bee Sting sauce, boasting hot honey, garlic, and red chili \u2013 a tantalizing combination. My wish is that they'd be more generous with the celery and carrot accompaniments given the portion size.\n\nThe potstickers, well, they were just okay, nothing that set them apart from your average Chinese takeout. On a brighter note, the cocktails at Clerys did manage to salvage our evening, offering a tasty respite.\n\nAreas of improvements: (1) Clerys could benefit from some quality control in the kitchen to elevate their food offerings. (2) When the place gets crowded, the restroom can become less than appealing.",

                "text": "My wife and I reserved a table at this restaurant for our last night on our honeymoon. This was other worldly! Our waitstaff was very attentive! We were never out of water or wine. The meals were well paced and delicious. I don't often weigh the display of food as it comes out, but it is very obvious that the Mistral takes note in how each dish is staged before sending them out to customers.\n\nOur appetizers were homey and a great wakeup to our pallets. The puff pastry texture and sweetness complimented the bisque beneath. The texture of the bisque was thinner than I would have imagined, but the texture and the flavor together worked well as an appetizer so that it wasn't too heavy to have before a main entr\u00e9e.\n\nI ordered the duck off of staff recommendation which came with a mushroom risotto and cranberry gastrique. Although plated together, there were very distinct flavors between each part of the meal. I would say this is the single most delicious meal I have ever had, and I don't say that lightly.\n\nMy wife ordered the salmon and enjoyed it (particularly the sauce gave an exciting and finishing flavor to the dish).\n\nOur wine was great! (I've added a photo of the specific wine we had two bottles of)\n\nThe only thing I would say is that the dessert, while still good, was not up to par. After an amazing appetizer, entr\u00e9e, and wine, I was a bit surprised to not be entirely wowed by the dessert. The staff did write congratulations on the plates as it was our honeymoon.\n\nOverall, if you want to go somewhere on the fancier more expensive side, I'd say come to the Mistral if you want above and beyond service with great food.",

Appetizers and main entrees were all well cooked, full of flavor. My favorite are the mushroom risotto in the half roasted duck and the tuna tartar. The bread \ud83c\udf5e with homemade butter was delicious as well. The linguine was on the hard and chewy side, I was told that\u2019s the more authentic Italian way to cook it. The knife used to cut into lamb can be sharpened, took some efforts to cut into it. Overall, nice vibe fancy restaurant for special occasions. Definitely not your everyday bistro.",

Every pizza is incredibly fresh, with house-made sauce and a perfectly crispy undercarriage. The duck is terrific and comes with delightful risotto, and the steak is a classic.

                "text": "I love the Mistral, it is my favorite restaurant in Boston. The service is always exceptional. Attention to detail is phenomenal, if you go to the bathroom they will tidy up your seat and even refold the table napkin. Plus, your water is always filled. They truly make you feel like VIP.\n\nThe waiter/waitress are always patient and will help you with any questions you may have. The food is amazing. The homemade bread and the butter are great. The sides that come with your entree always compliment/elevate the dish (no matter what you order). I always look forward to coming here and trying new dishes outside of my comfort zone because I know they have meticulously thought through the flavors.",

We ordered a few oysters a bowl of Clam Chowda which was excellent and we each got a Lobster roll, one with Mayo and one warm with butter.  Didn't realize how large they were and my husband and I split it to try each type.  It came with fries and coleslaw as well.  Our favorite between the 2 rolls was the warm by far. The cold one was a bit chewy and a couple pieces we weren't sure if they were fully cooked or not? Maybe the one with Mayo is supposed to be more chewy? We've never had a cold lobster roll. The hand cut steak fries were very good.  I did try the coleslaw and it seemed like it was just mixed with Mayo and didn't have much flavor at all.  My husband didn't even try his as he doesn't eat coleslaw out. He'll only eat mine that I make homemade. All in all this place was pretty good.",

                "text": "Typical Parisian bistro experience with great food and atmosphere.\n\nFor over two decades, Aquitaine has been offering a Parisian bistro experience in South End. Having enjoyed Chef Wood's other restaurants like Metropolis, I anticipated a similar quality at Aquitaine. True to form, the restaurant's interior, with its classic Parisian cafe vibes, burgundy couches, and tiled floors, set the perfect setting. During my recent visit on a weekday lunchtime, I found the place almost empty and was able to enjoy a leisurely meal.\n\nOf the three dishes I ordered, my least favorite was the Escargots Bourguignon. Unfortunately, the escargot was pre-seasoned, which made it excessively salty rather than just lightly sprinkled with salt. However, the Sandwich au Canard was a redemption. It featured a superb blend of duck confit, pickled onion, and sweet cherry jam, all encased in heavily butter-toasted bread. The extra crunch from the bread not only added satisfying crunch but also intensified the umami flavors of the duck confit.\n\nAfter the mixed experiences with the starter and the entr\u00e9e, the Profiteroles Parisienne provided an excellent finale to the meal. It's one of my favorite ways to conclude a meal at a French restaurant, and these were on par with the best I\u2019ve enjoyed at other French restaurants throughout the city.\n\nAlthough the food at Aquitaine might not be as \"innovative\" as advertised on their website, it still provides an enjoyable traditional French dining experience, if you select the right dishes. I would definitely consider returning for dinner to explore more of their signature entr\u00e9es.",

                "text": "This was my first \"fancy\" dinner in Boston after moving back. The service and vibes of the restaurant are absolutely fantastic. Just make sure you get a reservation, cause it gets busy!\n\nWe sat at the bar and the bartender was definitely nice, giving us solid recommendations and given us a show with different cocktails that were getting ordered.\n\nBest dish of all time here though was the Uni Shot. We loved it so much, we got 3 orders of it! It's the right balance of umami, savory, and herbs all packed in a single shot.\n\nWe also got the Crispy Rice with spicy tuna. Great balance of crunchy and soft texture. I think next time, we're going to try it with the scallops. 100% would recommend ordering it again.\n\nThe octopus ceviche was perfectly prepared with a great balance of sweet, spicy, and freshness from the onions and cilantro. And the Tamari Scallops had a nice pop in your mouth if you enjoy a sour + slimy texture.\n\nSushi was incredibly fresh and tightly-rolled. We ordered the Douzo Special Roll, Sumo Roll, Mt. Fuji Roll, Backbay Roll, Spider Roll, Caterpillar Roll, and Volcano Roll. Would definitely recommend any of these again for next time.\n\nSoft-Shell Crab was tasty but the only thing that would be a 3/5 since it was just a basic fried soft shell crab with tempera sauce. Would've loved a little bit more salt/pepper to bring out the briny-ness of the crab.\n\nFor Cocktails:\nDeath Jam (4/5) - nice balance of sweetness\nKabuchiko Martini (3/5) - definitely an interesting flavor to it, but probably wouldn't order it again\n\nOverall: it's definitely on the pricey-er side, so great for special occasions or if I wanted to splurge for some solid sushi.",

I tried clam chowder for the first time, and the flavors were exceptional. Truly, so so good. My waitress, April, was fully invested in my seafood journey and gave me fresh oyster to try. My mind was blown. I have clearly been missing out. Next came the lobster arancini - I wanted a slow intro to lobster - and YUM!! Paired with a glass of crisp bubble, these dishes were more than I bargined for in the best way possible. I treated myself to the lemon tart with raspberry, and I died of tart happiness. 20/10 Would bring my humans here.",

The oysters, mussels, and calamari were all delicious and at *peak* freshness. In fact, we had mussels again at a different restaurant later in the day and immediately noticed the difference in quality. The service was incredible as well. It was a hot day so we sat inside, but their back patio is perfect for an intimate meal. I highly recommend stopping in at B&G when you're in the mood for fresh seafood!",

                "text": "Good! What is there to say? If you are looking for a good place to have dinner in the area, B&G Oysters is the place to be. Open kitchen concept to create a bigger space ambiance with slightly limited indoor seating.\n\nSurprisingly there were quite a number of tables with kids too! The calamari \u2014 you can nevee go wrong with fried food, their raw oysters are amazing! Island Creek will always be the best tasting for me. The cocktail sauce they make is delicious with the oysters as well.\n\nFor entree the scallops were perfectly cooked, flavors and texture blended well in the dish. As for dessert, banana pudding is banana pudding\u2014 maybe also try the chocolate mousse and let me know!\n\nDrinks we had the Bee\u2019s Knees cocktail and 1 glass of 2022 Rose. It went perfectly with the apps. The only thing is that we were always asked if we\u2019re done with our plate. Anyway\u2014\n\nTil next time! Maybe brunch!",

We were celebrating a friend\u2019s birthday and our waiter generously offered the whole table some bubbles.\n\nWe ordered Grand Plateau (their seafood tower) and charcuterie board for appetizers. The seafood tower is mid - came with 3 pieces of lobster, 6 cocktail shrimps, tuna tartar, and a couple of raw oysters, raw clams, and mussels. Lobster and shrimps were both on the tougher side. A couple of my friends had sandy oysters. The prosciutto was delicious, however I was disappointed it did not come with cheese.\n\nI had the duck breast as my main. It\u2019s a bit tough to chew on the fatty parts but the rest was smooth and really delicious! The crispy rice is disappointing since it was barely crispy. It tasted like they shaped risotto rice into a disc and lightly pan fried it. The corn and veggie medley was crunchy and not to my taste.\n\nThey have a cake cutting fee - 12 USD per plate!",

Very thinly sliced, breaded and fried; with arugula, tomato and some other veggies on top. Chicken is very juicy and tender, despite being super thinly sliced! I loved the taste. Presentation is great looking. For desert, I got the flan which is great compliment to the meal. You also get nice bread with olive oil and to snack on.

                "text": "Let me be honest I have left the giving review industry a while ago, but I have been getting back on it because the reviews are very misleading half of the time.\n\nWhen I got there, there was a group waiting for me. It was a small Meetup that I believe happened before in that location. To my surprise when I walked in, it was really loud inside, often times on a summer night you expect noisy restaurants. What really bothered me was that me and my friend walked in and the only person who was welcoming was one girl who had a black hair.\n\nMy friend and I, we sat , about 20 minutes later not one person came by to check on us. See if we needed anything. At that point, there were seven of us seated on a table of 10 or so. My friend waved to a waiter so she can get services, the waiter, dead, looking in our eyes, then looked down and said nothing. Went back into the kitchen as if we did not exist.\n\nI took it upon myself to go to one of the bartenders, the bartender was really nice and said they would send somebody to help us. After someone finally came to our table and took some orders, they took the first five orders and completely skipped over the rest of us.\n\nSince this was a meet up, we were all going to pay separately. When we were ready to pay, the lady who was serving us, told us that we can only split the bill into two. Mind you everybody had their own way of paying some from cash other from card and etc.\n\nThe lady who was serving us also seemed very in a rush to stop helping us. Maybe I was the only one picking up on that. Anyway, one of our colleagues ordered the mashed potato and another one ordered the macaroni and cheese, they looked good and received good reviews from our colleagues. But the service was just really not it.\n\nWe all tried to have one person pay and then send that person either Cash app or give them cash for their trouble.\n\nA few advice :\n\n1. If you see a large group come in warn them that they can split the bill into two because some people don\u2019t have that much money on their card. We are not living in Malibu, we are in Massachusetts. Warn.\n\n2. Maybe checking on anybody within 10 minutes of them seating. We got water after I asked to have someone help us over 40 minutes into sitting.\n\n3. Even if someone is not serving a specific table, you can hear what the people need until their actual waiter. Hey, go check on your people. Instead of being rude and walking away as we\u2019re not trying to have a conversation or finding someone to help us.\n\n4. Please put the volume down. We were screaming over ourselves.\n\n5. I don\u2019t know if this was a typo, the chicken fried chicken is very questionable as a title without actually including chicken in the ingredient list.\n\nI give these reviews not to be mean, but to share my honest experience. This kind of felt like I was at rock-bottom. Majority of my party ended up going to another restaurant nearby. As much as it did not have the selections that we wanted from there, we enjoyed the atmosphere, and more importantly, the service.",

It's worth noting that the place is quite small, with only 3 or 4 stools for seating, so most people opt for takeout. Count me in for a return visit!

                "text": "The restaurant is located in the busy Boston Commons area, where parking is very difficult. There is a garage, but parking for the duration of a meal costs around $20+.\n\nThe restaurant\u2019s decor is very distinctive, featuring contemporary Chinese art. I particularly liked the dragon emblem in the men's restroom\u2014it\u2019s very cool.\n\nThe waitstaff are clearly well-trained and you can feel their professionalism. However, they seemed more trained than genuinely caring about the customers. For instance, we were seated next to a door that leads to the outside seating area. The servers frequently passed through it, causing strong drafts that made us uncomfortable. The restaurant was less than 50% full at the time, so we could have been seated at a more sheltered table.\n\nThe quality of the dishes is consistent with other PF Chang\u2019s locations\u2014very reliable. My favorites, the crispy fried green beans and chicken lettuce wraps, were as delicious as ever. The portions of the main courses were a bit small. The pepper steak, mapo tofu, and shrimp with lobster sauce were decent but not outstanding. Notably, the shrimp in the shrimp dish were smaller than those typically found in other Chinese restaurants.\n\nIn conclusion, I wouldn\u2019t choose to come back voluntarily.\n\nCurrently, the restaurant offers a $12.99 lunch special, which is economical and worth considering.",

It's located by Boston common and Public Garden - great for a group of people looking for some cool Asian food after all the activities around the area. Especially recommend for parents as they have good kids menus. Foods were neat and tasty served with good portion to share by plates. Liked their interior design being exotic and artistic. Seats were spacious and comfortable. Outdoor seating was available. Servers were kind and friendly. Nearby parking is very limited; some may be available along the Charles St. But recommend using the Boston Common garage.",

Literally nothing else. It took 2 requests for napkins and she did absolutely nothing to help clean up or take the aforementioned napkins we used to clean up. We had to ask for more soup as well. When we ordered, my husband asked what the rice options were for the meal we were ordering. She said brown, white and fried. He asked for the fried. She didn't tell us that there was a $4 up charge for the fried rice. We only noticed when we got the bill. She just kind of disappeared after the soup incident. Someone else brought our food out. She didn't come back to check on us until we were done and ready to leave.\n\nThe food was delicious though so that helped. Overall, not the best experience.  Definitely won't be going back to that one, but glad there are others we can visit because the food really was great.",

                "text": "For the past ten years I\u2019ve lived in Boston, Trident has often been my go to response for my favorite breakfast place in Boston. As I\u2019ve been trying and reviewing a bunch of (to me) new breakfast places around town it occurred to me it\u2019d probably been two years since I\u2019d eaten at Trident and so I was curious coming back to see if my memory was clouded by nostalgia or if it still remained at the top of my breakfast list.\n\nSpoiler alert: I still think it\u2019s the best breakfast in Boston.\n\nI ordered the corned beef hash which came with two eggs on top (I ordered mine over easy) and four slices of toast (they had a large selection and I got the sourdough rye which is a combination of my two favorite kinds of bread). I also ordered the loaded tots, and a \u201cchaider\u201d.\n\nThe corned beef hash is freshly made a just absolutely delicious. It incorporates more vegetables than one might expect: celery, carrots, cabbage, but I welcomed their inclusion. It made the hash tastier and more of a complete meal. I can think of only one other hash I\u2019ve eaten in my life that I\u2019d put above it at that\u2019s at a diner in Colorado. Sincerely, the hash is wonderful.\n\nThe tots were good. I think they\u2019re about as good as you can do with the concept, though if you want something similar but much better I\u2019d recommend the latkas at Zaftigs. But still they were delicious and felt decadent.\n\nAs much as I loved my main meal the highlight was the \u201cchai\u201d-der. I believe it\u2019s essentially a chai latte but made with cider instead of milk. It. Was. Amazing. One of the best beverages I\u2019ve ever poured down my gullet. I need to remember they have it so I can stop in whenever I\u2019m near Hynes. The combination of chai spices, and cinnamon, and rich cider flavor. It was as like a spicy hot cider and if that doesn\u2019t sound like heaven to you, then I pity your poor tastebuds. I should have ordered a second to go.\n\nI originally was going to eat inside but it was fairly crowded and it was a pleasant morning and nobody was sitting outside so I opted for that. You order virtually through a QR code at each table. You also pay first which felt weird to me. What if you want desert? I\u2019m paying the tip before getting the service? I recognize that this was a covid issue, but it did feel a bit backward. If it had been done in a regular way then I WOULD have ordered a second chaider.\n\nOne last thing, and I\u2019m not blaming the business as they had several wasp traps decorating the walls of the outdoor seating area, but eating outside mid-September I was besieged by wasps throughout my meal. Not to a horrific extent but enough to annoy me and if you\u2019re phobic of those pests then I advise eating inside.\n\nAnd one last thing: this is definitely a pricy breakfast option. For me it was worth it, but it felt extremely indulgent and it\u2019s not someplace I could afford to eat at regularly. But for when you\u2019re hankering for one of the best breakfasts available in Boston, it\u2019s my go to pick.",

For entrees we selected pepperoni pizza, shrimp scampi and pasta Bolognese. All were delicious. Full bar and wine list available, desserts and small plates to share. Service was good and the bustling atmosphere was okay ( you could still carry on a conversation).  We had a pleasant experience.",

I\u2019ve eaten at less expensive places with better food.\n\nI asked for medium rare and received what looks like almost rare. Cooking for another 1-2 minutes would\u2019ve made it perfect.

The salmon Caesar salad is by far the best I\u2019ve ever had. I can say the salmon itself is the best salmon I\u2019ve ever had as well. Tried a local beer this time (Jacks Abby House Lager) and that was excellent as well. Will definitely be back and would HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend. The calamari is also incredible!",

Communication and collaboration through the planning process were very easy and a delight throughout. We really appreciated the thought and care she put into making our day special, from printing out and framing welcome and table signs to saving the rest of the cake in the fridge after the wedding so we could take it home the next day to enjoy. And when I went to pick it up the next day, I had forgotten to take a menu the night of but the manager kindly printed out another copy for our keepsakes.\n\nThe food was superbly seasoned and portions generous. The eggplant meatballs were a standout appetizer and the little gem salad was also very tasty! My salmon entree was nice and hot, with decadent crispy skin. It can be tough to maintain the quality when serving many people, but they did an amazing job! They also made special other dishes to accommodate dietary restrictions.\n\nThe wine room was a very intimate and lovely venue. All the guests complimented the food and the whole evening.\n\nThank you to Sari and the whole team. Would highly recommend for a night out or any special event!",

It\u2019s very close to the Copley branch of the library and so conveniently located and just a super reliable spot for lunch. Probably my default option when I\u2019m looking for something near Copley.\n\nToday I had the spicy tofu lunch special which came with some small pork dumplings (I could have had spring rolls instead). The flavor of my meal was spot on, just the way I like it. Tofu wasn\u2019t great by themselves but the flavor was there. Dumplings were also just fine. From prior experience I would recommend the basil fried rice and they have this eggplant thing which I think is my favorite thing I\u2019ve tried there. Also the fresh Basil rolls are also really good.\n\nI will say, it\u2019s extremely standard Thai food and I don\u2019t think it cracks my top three Thai restaurants around boston, but it is tasty, reasonably priced, and great location. I\u2019ve probably eaten there close to twenty times. For me it\u2019s a comfort lunch at this point.",

The atmosphere and decor of the interior and exterior of the restaurant are amazing.  Our server that day was Joshua.  He was very pleasant,  courteous, and attentive to our requests.  He is very skilled at his profession and is a definite asset to Basile.  Myself and my friends enjoyed our meals heartily.  I chose the pumpkin ravioli, which I highly recommend.  In summary, I recommend Basile as a must stop for lunch or dinner when you are visiting Boston.",

We assumed the waitstaff would be familiar in knowing the menu's gluten-free items because we saw gluten-free options on the menu.\n\nHowever, when we wanted to confirm that the Gnocchi con Truffle was truly gluten-free, our waiter checked with the chef and told us it wasn't gluten-free.\n\nWhy is the gnocchi marked on the menu as gluten-free if it isn't? Our gluten-free guest was looking forward to enjoying that dish, but had to substitute with a plain tomato-sauce gluten-free pasta instead.\n\nWe appreciated that our waiter checked with the chef about the gluten-free status of the dishes we ordered, but it's disappointing to see something marked on the menu as gluten-free when it actually isn't.\n\nThere was also a long wait for our entrees, so service was much slower than we've experienced at other restaurants at a similar price point.\n\nOverall, I don't recommend this place and I think you can get a better experience at other similarly priced restaurants.",

We maybe should have said \u2018but let us know what it costs\u2019?\n\nEnding up at Oishii was the best outcome possible when it came to the food, the ambience, the service, and just overall experience. I kid about the price - yes, it\u2019s expensive - but I don\u2019t know that you\u2019ll find a cooler sushi spot anywhere in New England. The restaurant was busy on a Saturday night, and every table was packed with people having a great time. Date nights, large groups of friends - the energy was electric.\n\nThe presentation of the dishes alone was worth the trip, and the food lived up to everything else going on around it. If you want to splurge with no regrets - get yourself a table at Oishii.",

                "text": "Okay, this was entirely my fault. I got a little carried away by what I \u201cthought\u201d was the newly improved restaurant scene in Boston after having a few excellent meals at Japanese Spots here. This was not one of those meals.\n\nIn my defense: I scoped Oishii out extensively online. Looked at many pics, read through multiple online versions of their menu (which were very misleading\u2026).\n\nHere\u2019s the problem at Oishii: I\u2019m going to go out on a limb and say that at least 90% of the menu items are deep fried/tempura. Not kidding. There is this huge, long sushi bar fully staffed with chefs and they\u2019re deep frying every, damn thing. I\u2019m sure that sells. It\u2019s probably not a problem for them. Deep Fried sushi is not my thing and not why I came. So\u2026.my bad.\n\nI had actually planned what I was going to order/eat from reading thoseonline menus. Pretty much none of the items I was planning to order actually appeared on the menu last night. I\u2019m assuming they serve what sells for them: Tempura Everything. #eyeroll\n\nThe spot itself is very beautiful. Multiple levels, multiple bars and dining areas. Really lovely furnishings and serving plates, etc. Also? EXCELLENT Sake List. One of the best, most extensive I\u2019ve ever seen. Super impressive. If they had had even just a \u201cbasic\u201d sushi section on that menu Oishii might have worked for me. As in you can\u2019t just order some ala carte pieces of sushi and/or some simple rolls. (I was not given a menu including that. I can see one online. Maybe I should have asked. I just assumed the fancy, bound menu they gave me was the entire menu??) You must choose from a large page of very elaborate rolls. I managed to find two that did not contain deep fried ingredients. And one of those was a California Roll.\n\nOishii is A Lot of Show and very little substance. Looks good. Decent vibe. Underwhelming food. What they\u2019re serving is trying too hard. Everything is muddled. Too much tempura. Flavors and ingredients are not able to stand on their own.\n\nOn the upside: Portion size is ginormous. One roll will likely do you. So you could have a wonderful bottle of Sake and eat one giant Tempura something and be good!\n\nWhat I had:\n\nCucumber Salad: EXCELLENT. Best thing I had. Led me to have irrationally high expectations.\n\nFried Vegetable Dumplings: really disappointing. Fast food type dumpling that was overcooked.\n\nSpicy Salmon Crispy Rice: Very meh. I have no idea what was mixed in with the spicy salmon. But it was A LOT of stuff which made the entire piece too large. Almost impossible to eat. Which is a clear failure in the world of sushi. You must actually be able to get the piece into your mouth\u2026\n\nScallop Crispy Shiso (I think this was on the appetizer menu): Okay, this was DELICIOUS. But this is also an entire meal. Tempura shiso leaf with a scallop on top and then piled high with shredded, fried Taro. This is one of dishes you can order with your excellent Sake and be one and done!\n\nMixed Green Salad: I needed to cleanse my palate from all the fried\u2026basic salad. It was fine.\n\n\u201cReal\u201d California Roll with King Crab. It was good. Basic. Fine.\n\nFor the Love of Salmon Roll: Tobiko, Avocado, Cucumber, Seared King Salmon, Ikura, Shiso, Spicy Mayo. Really good, gigantic roll. Very \u201cbusy.\u201d Lots of things going on. Not usually my thing. But again, order one of these and you\u2019re good!\n\nI tried their \u201csignature dessert\u201d which is the definition of trying too hard. Hahahahahaha. So much going on. Presentation over substance. Cannot recommend. It\u2019s something like a big, frozen coconut egg with some espresso mousse inside sitting in a little base of yuzu with some berries. #eyeroll\n\nNice Date Spot. If you live in the area also nice spot. Not worth making the effort to travel to.",

I\u2019d use better quality eggs that have got a nice golden/orange yolk- but that\u2019s just personal preference.\n\nMy partner had the French toast banana bread which was 10/10.

Of course, we did not have a reservation, but the host was very kind. They took time and looked into their booking system, checking in with other staff and made us feel welcomed. They were accommodating and sat us at a bar. The bartender knew their drinks and food well. They were also very attentive to their guests\u2019 needs. We enjoyed our food very much as they were fresh and tasty. Couldn\u2019t have asked for a better meal on our last night in Boston! Highly recommended!!!",

                "text": "Brunch was the meal I ate at the Boston. MA location.  The location is convenient because a parking lot is next door, and it is close to other shopping or experiences in the area.  Our server was great , she was pleasant, patient, and friendly.  The food was served hot, and it came as they were described on the menu.  The Check-out process was easy because the server has a handheld device to accept your card payment.  While the food was fresh, all but the egg sandwich lacked seasoning;  so it makes me wonder if this place only has a cook and not a chef cooking/supervising its preparation.  Most restaurants regardless of who is serving the customer make it so every server can respond to or follow-up when your assigned server is overwhelmed but at this place although I was waiving my hand to get the hostess attention she ignored me until I got up from my chair to ask for more napkins and my check.  Eventually, I got both, but the hostess appeared frustrated that I asked for this help.  If I had to eat here again, I would if I had to stay local, but I would go with the egg sandwich because that did have a flavor that my mouth enjoyed.",

                "text": "I recently had a wonderful dining experience at this charming restaurant in Boston with lovely outdoor seating that offers a great view of the bustling street. The atmosphere was perfect for enjoying a relaxing meal in the city.\n\nThe waitstaff were attentive and friendly, ensuring we had everything we needed throughout our meal. We started with some fresh bread served with olive oil, which was a simple yet delicious way to begin. For the main course, we ordered the black truffle mushroom pasta, which was rich and flavorful, paired with a fresh salad that balanced the meal perfectly.\n\nOne of the most creative touches was when I ordered a glass of wine, and it came with a thoughtful card detailing information about the wine. It made the experience feel even more special and personal. Overall, the food was excellent, the service impeccable, and the outdoor seating was a great spot to enjoy a meal with a view. Highly recommended!",

I tried ordering a Mediterranean style sandwich in the menu and the guy who works there preparing the sandwiches insulted me for no reason. I could not believe it. Never have been treated that way. If he was having a bad day, he should have stayed at home. Why would I want to keep spending money there? If I could give it 10 negative stars, I would. I'm not going back there as long as the rude sandwich guy works there. If you happen to visit there, remind the rude sandwich guy to treat his customers better.",

We stopped in for drinks and appetizers & loved it. You check in downstairs so you get to walk those iconic steps (there is an elevator, I think, from the upper level). We were seated in the lower level, the service was excellent, and the food tasted great. We will definitely be back on our next visit to Boston.",

Staff and patrons alike were friendly and quite helpful. Service is slow and a bit unorganized when it comes to needing to order food, but the Bartender Dave did his best to keep up. He was awesome with the drinks, and that in itself kept him hopping.\nThe food was pretty good. We had the Quesadillas, Clam Chowder, and Sam's Turkey Sandwich. I even got to sit at Norm's corner seat! I was also able to snag a cute Christmas Ornament in the  cute little gift shop.",

Alexander made us feel incredibly welcome with his warm character and attentiveness. He served us a variety of beef that we fell in love with at the first bite, including our chosen Wagyu beef, which truly exceeded our expectations. Alexander\u2019s enthusiasm and commitment to excellence made the experience even more special. His genuine passion for what he does left a lasting impression on our family, and his marvelous service transformed an already fantastic meal into an unforgettable evening. Additionally our waiter Ariel, provided an excellent service through his efforts of being attentive without being intrusive and made sure every detail was perfect, from offering insightful recommendations to ensuring our glasses were never empty. Thank you, Alexander, and Thank you, Ariel, for making our night so memorable\u2014we\u2019ll definitely be back!",

If you get there before 11 or on a less busy day, the atrium tables are the best study spot. Render\u2019s coffee is great, and their breakfast sandwiches are my absolute favorites. The baristas are always super nice and efficient as well",

Meatballs were nice and well salted, which made them even better with the slices of sourdough. The Salty Pig pizza was very savory with the various cuts of cured pork but also sweet from the caramel drizzle. Cannot recommend this place enough!\n\nThe total came out to $34, but it was definitely an amount to be shared. Left with half a pizza for tomorrow.",

We were early, so they sat us outside for lattes & a pastry basket, \"just to stay in shape,\" as Eck would say.\nWe moved inside for our early afternoon meal, and the fun really started!\nOur selected drinks were across the board - more lattes, wine, a mocktail, and black coffee. The Amande Douce was a delightful combo of orgeat [almond syrup], lemon juice, and orange juice.\nA few of us shared the escargot, which were a treat, but maybe a tad over salted. The extra sauce was wonderful for bread dipping, while the brightness of the mocktail was a match for the hearty garlic.\nOnce again, we gave the menu a thorough workout as our selections ranged from a beautiful onion soup, French toast, mushroom crepes to both smoked salmon and prosciutto mortadella waffles.\nWe shared tastes and thoroughly enjoyed our selections! Several boxes were required to bring the delicious remains home to extend our gourmet feast to another day.\nUnfortunately, we were much too full for even a glance at the amazing desserts. We observed a variety delivered to neighboring tables, but, alas, not this time.\nAhhhhh. Gastronomic Satisfaction.\nMerci, Petit Robert!",

The most impressive dish was the beets salad. Beets are not in my regular diet, but this dish is amazing that I\u2019m glad I took a try. Different kinds of beets were slight sweet and had different textures, balanced well with the crunch walnut and sweet strawberry. It had a tiny biscuit on top as well. A very creative and memorable dish. Highly recommend.\n\nI ordered a latte to pair with my chocolate mousse in the end. To my surprise, the latte is only around $5. I would consider it very affordable for a French restaurant. Good coffee as well.",

                "text": "Where to start for this iconic mainstay on Newbury Street.  Let\u2019s with the ambiance.  Stepping into this very extraordinary space, one notices the true French vibe immediately with a rich veneer of burgundy and oak gracing everything from the booths to the classy chairs.  French revelry is what comes to mind, especially when you come to the bar, which purportedly has the original Zinc top from its namesake in Marseilles.  Very unique and elegant.  And if you like the art and allure of B&W prints, the owner\u2019s (an accomplished photographer) works graces the walls, with stars from yesteryear like Steve McQueen etc.\n\nI happened to stop by on a recent Saturday evening, and while it was very busy, the very gracious and charming host, Heaven, managed to get me the one remaining spot at the bar.  Right from that amazingly warm entrance to an equally welcoming manager, Ilham, I felt transported to a very relaxed atmosphere of an authentic French bistro.\n\nAn even more pleasant experience was having Alejandra at the bar, a very able and gregarious person.  Her experience and zeal manifests in amazing creations, such as the La Poire Royale, an amazing blend of cognac, brandy, orange liqueur, lime and sparkling wine.  This is her signature cocktail, very unique, strong and enjoyable. There is also a great selection of wines, especially French, which stands to reason.  For starters I had outstanding French Onion soup (where else but here), but the main course of the Dover Sole seared in brown butter, with capers and a side of truffled mashed potatoes was just delectable.  The fish had to be deboned first, and Alejandra did a masterful job at it.  The very moist, flaky and flavorful fish was one of the best I have ever had.  The meal was just very special and a delight, made possible  with the amazing service and the congeniality of the staff.\n\nThis is a great place to have a very different experience and cuisine on Newbury Street, whether it be a special occasion or an evening out with friends.  I will definitely be returning.\n\nUpdate:  On a subsequent trip with a friend tried the Escargots and Foie Gras appetizers and they were just outstanding.  But the main course, once again, was just very mouthwatering and well balanced.  The Loup de Mer (Bass) and the Sole Meuni\u00e8re hit the spot, capped off by a must-try Lile Flottante (French Meringue) dessert.  An accompanying bottle of delicate Sancerre, made for another very satisfying gastronomic experience.",

The topping and the sauce did not belong on the pizza which as a family of 6 with a big appetite, 3/4 of the pizza was left on the table.\n\nThird, the Pasta:\nChicken Pasta Fettuccine(\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f) had noodles that were undercooked. Really felt I was just chewing on cooked flour. And the flavor overall was very watery.\n\nShrimp Scampi Zuccini(\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f) also had noodles that were undercooked. Although the shrimp and zuccini was ok, the portion was smaller compared to other pastas and the flavor did not wow me.\n\nBolognese sphagetti(\u2b50\ufe0f): don't let the fancy description get you, this is just a too plain sphagetti that everybody had more than once in their life. To be honest my elementary school served better sphagettis with more meat and sauce. It was to bland; barely any sauce or meat chunks(which makes the sphagetti THE sphagett).\n\nFourth, the salad: Classic Caesar(\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f): The chicken breast was tender with the hint of smokiness, and what could you hate about a salad? Anyways very disappointing how this restaurant is very pricey and is apparently known for their pizza but the most o-kay dish was the salad ..\n\nLast but not least, the customer service(\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f): First of all when our family entered the restaurant I don't understand how we were welcomed with side eyes??? Not only that when the foods were served the waitress did not even come once to ask of the foods alright or it fits our taste. This was very disappointing.\n\nOverall, my family spend about 300$ in this restaurant and I could say with complete sureness that we are never coming to this place again in Boston.\n\nThe parking's free though. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f The free parking and caesar salad was the best here....",

The drink itself was a bit disappointing\u2014too much chocolate made it taste more like a chocolate smoothie rather than a balanced mocha latte. While the drink wasn\u2019t terrible, I expected better for nearly $8.\n\nOn a positive note, the cafe has a charming rustic ambiance and offers a cozy coffeehouse experience. The staff were also friendly and helpful. Overall, while the atmosphere and service were commendable, the drink and its price left something to be desired.",

I know I am a traveler from a country with no habit of tips, but if I am not happy, I am not urged to give you tips. Plus the waiter does not appear to be in good mood at the start. A bit too unhappy to serve me.",

The burger was good, but it took a very long time to get my food.  The waiter wasn't exactly rude, but seemed agitated and not very helpful. And the burger was $18. Kind of expensive. The second time I went, I met 8 or 9 friends and we had drinks.  The same waiter was very rude this time and absolutely refused to split the tab so we could all pay for our drinks individually. I understand they add gratuity for groups, and we were fine with dividing that onto each bill, but he still refused, and got angry and down right hostile when we objected. Luckily there were only a couple of us that weren't carrying cash so we were able to chip in and pay the bill. I have NEVER been to a bar that refused to give individual tabs. If I'm ever back in Boston, I won't be returning. You're probably thinking we were being a bunch of Karen's, but most of the group was Canadian. Do you have any idea how hard it is to make Canadian's mad?  That waiter succeeded. Lol.",

### Alex Flinchum:
My name is Alex Flinchum, I am a Graduate student at Boston University working on my Masters in Software Development.
I decided to get my Masters so that I could further my knowledge within the Software Development landscape.
I have been working at General Motors in both a **Software Engineer** and **QA Tester** roll working on Web Applications and Automated Testing. 
I have a solid background in *Java*, as well as many other languages such as *Angular* and *Python*. 
In my Undergrad career at Indiana University, I worked in an organization as an intern working on Web applications for neighboring business. 
One of these applications specifically used *php* to create interactive biking trails for people in the city to follow. 
I also had a specialty tied to my Undergrad major that focus on game development that allowed me to work on all aspects of a game, including art, sound, and music.
I'm Looking forward to creating a project from scratch in a more team focused setting.

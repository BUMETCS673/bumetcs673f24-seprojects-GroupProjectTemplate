### Amanda Yee
Hi! I'm Amanda, originally from the Gold Coast in Australia, now based in New York. I'm currently completing my Master's in Software Development at Boston University, and this is my final course in the program. For the past six years, I've worked as a Data Scientist and am now looking to transition into a Web Developer role. I have experience in Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm excited to dive into React for this semester-long project.

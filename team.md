**Srujana Niranjankumar** - QA Leader  
Hello! My name is Srujana, and I am a first-year MSCS student at Boston University. I have coding experience in:

*(and have some basic knowledge about Unix shell scripting, Git, and Prolog.)*

I worked as a Software Development Engineer-1 for 2 years before coming to BU.
I generally play adventure RPG video games in my free time. My favourite saying/quote is:
